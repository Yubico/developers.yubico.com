[Note]
======
Yubico has declared end-of-life for the YubiKey Validation Server (YK-VAL) and YubiKey Key Storage Module (YK-KSM). These have been moved to link://github.com/YubicoLabs/yubikey-ksm[YubicoLabs] as a reference architecture. See article, link:/support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021227000[YK-VAL, YK-KSM and YubiHSM 1 End-of-Life].

If you don't want to use YubiCloud, you can host one of these validation server(s) yourself.
