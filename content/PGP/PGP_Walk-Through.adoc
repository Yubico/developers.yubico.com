== PGP Walk-Through

We are going to walk through link:https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/[Yubico's PGP support] for signing and encryption, and explain how the PGP interaction works, step by step. Server and client registration and authentication ceremonies are incorporated through the backend in the key handling processes.

TIP: This walk-through is designed for people who prefer to *learn by doing*. If you prefer learning concepts from the ground up, check out our link:https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/[PGP developers guide]. You might find this walk-through and the guide are complementary to each other.

The walk-through is divided into several sections:

* *Overview* teaches you the fundamentals of PGP

* *Setup* provides a starting point for you to follow the walk-through

* *Configure YubiKey* explains the OpenPGP requirements and parameters

* *Loading Keys* explains the steps to generate or import encryption master keys and subkeys

* *Upload your Public Key to a Key server* explains the steps to ensure your email recipients can decrypt your encrypted email.

=== Overview

Configure the YubiKey with PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to encrypt and sign your data and communications. PGP is based on the open standard link:https://www.openpgp.org/[OpenPGP]. PGP is used in Gnu and Linux environments for email encryption. It also provides a toolbox to handle many common cryptographic operations.

For OpenPGP reference, see link:https://www.openpgp.org/[OpenPGP] and for the download site, see link:https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html[GnuPG].

Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) is the tool to use with OpenPGP standard. It is designed and used for personal data privacy, not necessarily for building into a larger framework. Use the set-up here to load your personal PGP keys (public and private key pair) onto YubiKeys.

In this context, the YubiKey is acting similar to a smart card. It holds the PGP authentication, signing, and encryption keys. It provides a framework for loading the YubiKey.

*YubiKey features*

* It is a USB device that is both a smart card and a smart card reader; there is no extra hardware needed beyond the YubiKey.

* It stores the private and public key.

* All the encryption and decryption occur on the YubiKey, not on the computer.

*YubiKey with PGP*

* Can be configured and used with any application that supports OpenPGP smart cards.

* Requires firmware 5.2 and above to support the OpenPGP elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) keys option.

* Ideal for encryption with email or files.

The focus of this walk-through is to load your PGP keys onto your YubiKey. With the configuration steps you complete here, your users can use a YubiKey to load your personal PGP key. You and your users can then share your personal authentication, using peer to peer authentication. With this, you and your users can send, receive, encrypt, and decrypt email content. Also, you can have your application refer to these PGP keys for authentication and access.


==== Prerequisites
Download required packages.

* YubiKeys using OpenPGP are typically configured using link:https://www.gnupg.org/[GnuPG (GPG)].  Select from the download tab.

* For some MacOS or Linux OS's use link:https://gpgtools.org/[GPGTools]. This is typically preinstalled in most MacOS computers.

* For Windows, select link:https://gpg4win.org/download.html[Gpg4win] (includes Kleopatra)

* YubiKey Manager, to ensure that the operating system recognizes the YubiKey as a smart card.

YubiKey Manager is available for Windows, OSX, and Linux. Installers for the different operating systems can be downloaded from the Yubico website using the links listed at: link:https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubikey-manager/[YubiKey Manager]


=== Setup

This walk-through does not describe how to use OpenPGP; for that see the link:https://www.openpgp.org/community/[OpenPGP community] or instructions provided by the service using OpenPGP. This walk-through also does not describe PGP with YubiKey client/server configuration. The tools all handle that.

This walk-through is about loading your RSA keys onto YubiKeys. When you complete this walk-through, you have:

* A PGP-enabled public-key cryptosystem.

* A YubiKey smart card that holds a private key.

* A device with a common interface that meets Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS), for example link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html[PKCS#11].



=== Configure YubiKey

link:https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubikey-manager/[YubiKey Manager] handles all these tasks.


==== Task Prerequisites

* link:https://www.gnupg.org/[GnuPG] version 2.0.2 or later. Understand how GnuPG works. See link:https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/[GnuPG documentation], usage and setting PIN and reset codes.

* Importing key, must be an RSA 2048 bit key.

* YuibiKey admin PIN. An OpenPGP admin password.

* YubiKey OpenPGP module version 1.0.5 or later. YubiKeys 4 and newer devices meet this requirement.


==== Verify and GPG and PGP Prerequisites

*Step 1.* Open a command terminal, with GPG installed.

*Step 2.* (Optional) Check the version of the OpenPGP firmware:

If you are using a YubiKey 4 or later, skip this step.

a)	Insert your YubiKey in the computer.

b)	Run the command:

`$ gpg-connect-agent --hex "scd apdu 00 f1 00 00" /bye`

`D[0000]  01 00 05 90 00                             .....`

`OK`

In this example `01 00 05` means version 1.0.5

*Step 3.* Ensure that CCID (chip card interface device) mode is enabled.

From the YubiKey Manager, select *Devices > your_device > Settings > Connection mode*.


==== Set the OpenPGP parameters.

From the command terminal, enter the listed GPG commands and verify the responses. For a list of `gpg-card` commands, type `gpg -help`.

*Step 1.* Open `gpg-card` options.

=== Loading Keys

*NOTE:* Ensure your laptop is disconnected from the internet.

Load existing or generate new PGP keys to a YubiKey.  Two key types are required: Master key that never changes. Sub keys that can change. There can be multiple Sub-keys per Master key.

  * Master key – used to manage. The master key cannot expire.
  * Sub keys – can be assigned conditions, for example expiration dates. Flash sign-in sub key and make new one. Keep master key.

*Step 1* Preparing Keys. Choose to Import or Generate keys.

*Import Existing Key.*

To get the PGP keys off of a USB drive with the keys and onto the YubiKey:

a)	Insert the USB thumb drive into the computer. Using File Explorer or Finder, locate the drive assigned to the USB drive. For example, D: or E: or whatever.

b)	From command terminal, change to the location of the USB drive. For example:

`$ cd D:`

c)	Confirm that the public and private keys are on the thumb drive by typing into the command terminal:

`$ dir`

This command displays a list files on the thumb drive.

d)	Confirm that the keys are on your hard drive GPG key ring by typing into the command terminal:

`$ gpg --list-secret-keys`

e)	Run the import command on both the public and the private keys.

This is a two-step process: First we import the keys onto the hard drive GPG key ring. Then transfer the keys from the hard drive onto the YubiKey.

To execute the first step, type the following into the command terminal:

`$ gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import [my_private_key.asc]`

This command imports both the public and the private key.

*Generate a Master Key.*

Complete this task only if do not have an RSA key to load. (If you generate a key on device, you do know where the device has been because you cannot export without the device and admin-never share option. If you use the import a key option, you can have a backup.)

If you have keys, skip this step and proceed to Step 2.

First your create Master key. Then your create sub-keys (Step 2).

a) Initiate the command driven wizard.

The secret key is no longer stored on your computer. A pointer on the computer indicates that the secret key is stored on the YubiKey smart card.

*Step 5.* Confirm the keys are ‘sharded’ by using Kleopatra.

Open Kleopatra and navigate to the certificates list. A card icon next to each key indicates it is ‘sharded’.


=== Upload Your Public Key to a Keyserver

*Step 1.* Reconnect your laptop to the Internet.

*Step 2.* Open Kleopatra and select *File > Export Certificates*.

The default keyserver is Kleopata is `keys.gnupg.net`

To change the keyserver, select *Settings > Configure Kleopatra*


=== Demo – Using Thunderbird

To test your email encryption using the YubiKey keys you created in this walk-through, use the open source Mozilla email tool, Thunderbird.

==== Prerequisites

 * Required: link:https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/[Thunderbird email]

 * Required: link:https://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php[Enigmail add-on]. To link:https://www.enigmail.net/home/donations.php[donate to Enigmail]

 * Optional: link:https://exquilla.zendesk.com/home[ExQuilla]

ExQuilla lets Thunderbird communicate to your Microsoft Exchange server in the EWS protocol.

It won’t make new email notification any better.

But will download email just as fast and will transfer over your existing Outlook folders better than if you configure Thunderbird with IMAP (assuming that your Microsoft Exchange server still supports IMAP).

It costs $10 / annually after a 60-day trial license.


==== Configure Enigmail

Ensure your encryption keys are ready. Complete the steps in this walk-through.

*Step 1.*	Start the Enigmail setup wizard.

*Step 2.*	The *Enigmail Setup Wizard > Key Selection > Create A Key To Sign And Encrypt Email* panel, displays the following message:

We have detected that you already have an OpenPGP key. You can either use one of your existing keys to sign, encrypt and decrypt emails, or you can create a new key pair.

*Step 3.*	Click the option, *I want to select one of the keys below to signing and encrypting my email*.

*Step 4.*	Select the Account/User ID you created.

If your Account/User ID and Key ID are listed, you have successfully implemented the YubiKey PGP encryption configuration.


=== Wrapping up
Congratulations! You've completed all the steps to encrypt and authenticate with a PGP credential.
