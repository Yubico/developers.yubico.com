== SSH Authentication to GitHub Using a YubiKey on Windows

This guide explains how to configure the Git client on Windows for accessing GitHub over SSH with a YubiKey’s OpenPGP application. 

The YubiKey 5, YubiKey 4, and YubiKey NEO support the OpenPGP interface for smart cards. This can be used with GPG4Win for encryption and signing, as well as for SSH authentication. These can in turn be used by several other useful tools, like Git, Cygwin, etc. This guide will help you set up the required software for getting SSH to work on Windows with the YubiKey OpenPGP application.
