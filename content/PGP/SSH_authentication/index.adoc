== SSH authentication
A YubiKey with OpenPGP can be used for logging in to remote SSH servers. In
this setup, the Authentication subkey of an OpenPGP key is used as an SSH key
to authenticate against a server. To ensure that the only way to log in is by
using your YubiKey we recommend disabling password login on your SSH server.
