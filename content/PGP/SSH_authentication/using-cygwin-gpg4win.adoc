== Using Cygwin with GPG4Win


link:https://cygwin.com/install.html[Cygwin] provides a Unix-like terminal with several useful tools, such as SSH. 

During installation, you will be asked which packages to install. 

	*	Do not install ``gpg``, as you will use the already installed ``GPG4Win``.  

	*	Make sure to install ``ssh-pageant`` to allow the included SSH client to use the YubiKey for authentication.  

After installation, open a Cygwin shell and edit the ``~/.bashrc`` file adding the following at the bottom:

		# ssh-pageant #
		eval $(/usr/bin/ssh-pageant -r -a "/tmp/.ssh-pageant-$USERNAME")
