== What is PGP? ==
abbr:OpenPGP[Pretty Good Privacy] is an open standard for signing and encrypting. It enables RSA or ECC sign/encrypt operations using a private key stored on a smartcard (such as the YubiKey NEO), through common interfaces like PKCS#11.

[NOTE]
====
 - For the PGP application the YubiKey only supports RSA keys. ECC keys are not supported.
 - PGP is not used for web authentication.
====

=== Advantages
PGP has the following advantages:

 - *De facto standard* in the Gnu/Linux world and for e-mail encryption.
 - *Flexible*. PGP is a crypto toolbox that can be used to perform all common operations.

=== Usage

The OpenPGP functionality of YubiKeys is typically used through GnuPG so we refer to its documentation for the full reference.
====
On macOS, GnuPG might not work in conjunction with other software, like OpenSC for example. link:https://gpgtools.org/[GPGTools] is the recommended alternative.
====

The default PIN set is ‘123456’ and the default admin PIN is ‘12345678’, these should be changed, see link:https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/Card_edit.html[Card edit].

== Configure the PGP features of a YubiKey
The YubiKey NEO can be configured and used with any application with support for OpenPGP Card:

 - link:Card_edit.html[Card edit]
 - link:SSH_authentication[SSH authentication]
 - link:Git_signing.html[Git signing]


== YubiKey firmware
The OpenPGP support in the YubiKey NEO is provided by the open source link:/ykneo-openpgp[ykneo-openpgp] applet.

Yubico has learned of a security issue with the OpenPGP Card applet project that is used in the YubiKey NEO. This vulnerability applies to you only if you are using OpenPGP, and you have the OpenPGP applet version 1.0.9 or earlier.
