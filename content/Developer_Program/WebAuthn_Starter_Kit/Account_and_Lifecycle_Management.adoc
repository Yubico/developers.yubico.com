== Account and lifecycle management

=== Introduction to account and lifecycle management

==== Overview Pre-requisites


Once the user has enrolled for the FIDO credentials to FIDO authenticator, it can be used for FIDO authentication to the WebAuthn Relying Party. However, there are a couple of considerations to be made as regards to account and lifecycle management of the FIDO authenticator and its FIDO credentials. The account management functions are illustrated in the Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication flowchart. The account management functions implemented for the WebAuthn Starter Kit are on a high level:

 * *List FIDO authenticators:* This feature lists all FIDO authenticators that are associated with a specific user at the WebAuthn Relying Party. Based on this list, the FIDO authenticators can be edited or deleted from the account.

 * *Add FIDO authenticator:* This feature can be used for adding a FIDO authenticator to a specific user account. In order to make sure that the user does not get locked out from the account, it is recommended to add a backup FIDO authenticator to each user’s account.


 * *Edit FIDO authenticator:* By using this feature, the FIDO authenticator’s nickname at the Relying Party can be modified. This feature is useful to name the FIDO authenticators with meaningful names, in particular to distinguish between the primary and secondary (backup) FIDO authenticator.


 * *Remove FIDO authenticator:* With this feature, a FIDO authenticator can be removed from a user account at the Relying Party. This is equivalent to revoking a FIDO authenticator. It should be noted that the FIDO authenticator is only deleted from the Relying Party, so the FIDO credentials are still present at the FIDO authenticator.


 * *Change U2F Password:* This feature can be used for changing the U2F Password for the user's account at the Relying Party, which is used as first factor authentication when using the FIDO authenticator for the U2F with Password flow. The U2F Password should be set to a complex password, while the FIDO authenticator PIN may have a lower complexity. The reason for this difference is that the U2F Password is more exposed to the Internet and can be subject to attacks, while the FIDO authenticator is in the user’s possession and will get blocked after too many failed PIN attempts.


 * *Show recovery codes:* This feature shows the recovery codes to the user, who should make a note of the recovery codes. The recovery codes should be stored securely, for example with a password manager.


 * *Generate recovery codes:* With this feature the user can generate new recovery codes. This should be done when the user has ran out of recovery codes or if there is a risk that the recovery codes could have been compromised.


 * *Delete account:* This feature can be used for deleting the entire user’s accounts. Needless to say, it should be used with great care.


By using the features listed above, various lifecycle management processes can be designed. In particular, it is possible to implement a procedure for replacing a FIDO authenticator that may have been lost or stolen. In such a scenario, the administrator should remove the user’s FIDO authenticator from the Relying Party, allow the user to login temporarily with backup codes, and instruct the user to add a new FIDO authenticator to the account.

==== Pre-requisites

The account and lifecycle management features described in this section are based on the account management and account recovery overview outlined in the Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication Flow in conjunction with the specification in the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/[W3C WebAuthn standard].

It is recommended to study the documents mentioned above as a pre-requisite.

Furthermore, a user account and corresponding FIDO authenticator must be registered, as described in the page High Level WebAuthn Registration Flow.

==== Purpose of this section

This section describes account and lifecycle management by using Microsoft Windows, an Apple iOS smartphone with the Safari browser, and an Apple iOS smartphone with an app that implements WebAuthn.

=== Account management using Microsoft Windows

==== Client configuration for Windows

The client configuration for Windows is described in this section.

==== FIDO authenticators

The FIDO2 authenticators used in this section is the following:

 * One YubiKey 5Ci is used as the primary FIDO2 authenticator. This YubiKey has been enrolled as described in the High Level Registration document.


 * One YubiKey 5C Nano s used as the backup FIDO2 authenticator. The YubiKey 5 is reset, so there are no FIDO2 credentials or PIN-codes set.



==== Account management web page for Windows
The web page for account management is shown in the picture below. This account management page is displayed when the user has logged in with FIDO2 to https://localhost:8080/. In the sub-sections below it is assumed that the user is logged in with FIDO2 to this web page.

image::Images/acct1-account-mgmt-web-page-v2.png[]
*Figure 1 - Account management web page*

In the account management web page, there are the following features:

 * *Edit the FIDO authenticator (security key) name:* This feature allows the user to change the name(s) of the registered FIDO authenticator(s) (security keys).


 * *Add new FIDO authenticator (security key):* With this feature, the user can add a new (backup) FIDO authenticator to the account.


 * *Delete a FIDO authenticator (security key):* With this feature, the user can delete a FIDO authenticator associated with the account.


 * *Change U2F Password:* If there is a U2F Password associated with the account, the user can change the U2F Password by using this feature.


 * *Show Recovery Codes:* This feature allows the user to show the recovery codes and optionally generate new ones.


 * *Delete your account:* This feature can be used for deleting the entire user’s accounts. Needless to say, it should be used with great care.


Details on how to perform those operations, and the related UX, are described in the sub-sections below.

=== Account recovery

If the user has lost its FIDO authenticator, the account must be recovered. There are essentially two scenarios:

 * The user has already registered a backup FIDO authenticator for the account.

 * The user had only one FIDO authenticator registered for its account.

These scenarios are discussed in the sections below. Microsoft Windows is used for describing account recovery, but the principles are the same for the other clients.

==== A backup FIDO authenticator exists

In this scenario, the user has already registered a backup FIDO authenticator for its account by following the process in the section "Adding a FIDO authenticator for Windows".

To recover the account with a backup FIDO authenticator, the user should take the following actions:

*Step 11.1.* Login to the account by using WebAuthn with the backup FIDO authenticator. See section "WebAuthn authentication using Microsoft Windows" for more information.

*Step 11.2.* When logged in, the user should *remove* the lost FIDO authenticator from the account. See section "Deleting a FIDO authenticator for Windows" for more information. When doing so, the lost FIDO authenticator is “revoked” at the WebAuthn Relying Party, and cannot be used for logging in anymore.

*Step 11.3.* The user should *add* a new backup FIDO authenticator to its account. See section "Adding a FIDO authenticator for Windows" for more information.

After performing these steps, the user has recovered the account with a new backup FIDO authenticator.

==== A new FIDO authenticator must be registered

In this scenario, the user had only one FIDO authenticator registered for its account. This means that the user must use the recovery codes for logging into the account. The recovery codes must be used only temporarily in an emergency situation or for account recovery.

To recover the account with recovery codes, the user should make sure to have the recovery codes at hand. Then the user should take the following actions.

*Step 12.1:* The user enters their username then selects the option to “Forgot Your Security Key”.

image::Images/acct46-login-another-way-v2.png[]
*Figure 46 - Login another way*

*Step 12.2:* The user enters a valid recovery code in the list and presses the button “Continue”. (The recovery codes need not be entered in chronological order, but the one that is entered has to be an active “non-used” recovery code.)

image::Images/acct47-enter-recovery-code-v2.png[]
*Figure 47 - Enter recovery code*

*Step 12.3:* The user is logged in and can access the administration page (see Figure 18). If the user hits the button “Recovery Codes”, the Recovery Codes menu will appear and show that there are only 4 Recovery Codes remaining (from the original 5 that were generated). If all recovery codes have been used, the user can generate new ones by pressing the button “Generate”.

image::Images/acct48-list-recovery-codes-v2.png[]
*Figure 48 - List of recovery codes*

*Step 12.4:* When logged in, the user should *remove* the lost FIDO authenticator from the account. See section "Deleting a FIDO authenticator for Windows" for more information. When doing so, the lost FIDO authenticator is “revoked” at the WebAuthn Relying Party, and cannot be used for logging in anymore.

*Step 12.5:* The user should *add* a new backup FIDO authenticator to its account. See section "Adding a FIDO authenticator for Windows" for more information.

After performing these steps, the user has recovered the account with a new backup FIDO authenticator.
