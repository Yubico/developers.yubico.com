== Developer Guides ==
The Yubico Developer Program provides workshops, documentation, implementation guides, APIs and SDKs to aid in rapid integration of Yubico technologies including YubiKey integration using any of the supported protocols: FIDO U2F, FIDO2, One-time password (OTP), PIV (smart card), and OpenPGP. These resources can all be found on the developer site.

=== FIDO2/WebAuthn ===
The FIDO2/WebAuthn open authentication specifications enable strong first-factor, second-factor, and multi-factor authentication options.

* link:/WebAuthn/Libraries/Using_a_library.html[Using a WebAuthn library]

=== One-Time Password (OTP)
Yubico OTP is a simple yet strong authentication mechanism that is supported by all YubiKeys. Yubico OTP can be used as the second factor in a 2-factor authentication model or on its own, providing first-factor authentication.

* link:/OTP/Libraries/Using_a_library.html[Using a Yubico OTP library]

=== Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
The YubiKey provides smart card features based on the Personal Identity and Verification Card (PIV) standard over the CCID protocol, which supports smart cards on a USB interface. This enables you to perform RSA or ECC sign and decrypt operations using a private key stored on the YubiKey.

* link:/PIV/Guides/SSH_with_PIV_and_PKCS11.html[SSH with PIV and PKCS11]

=== OpenPGP
OpenPGP is a standards-based public key cryptography for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, SSH, etc. Both the YubiKey 4 series and Yubikey NEO can securely hold a PGP key.

* link:/PGP/SSH_authentication/[SSH authentication]

=== YubiHSM 2
The YubiHSM 2 provides advanced cryptography, including hashing, asymmetric and symmetric key cryptography, to protect the cryptographic keys that secure critical applications, identities, and sensitive data in an enterprise for certificate authorities, databases, code signing and more.
