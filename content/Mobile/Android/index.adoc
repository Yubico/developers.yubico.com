=== Yubico Android SDK

Yubico Android SDK (YubiKit for Android) is an Android library provided by Yubico to enable interaction between YubiKeys and Android devices. The library supports NFC-enabled and USB YubiKeys.

Documentation for the SDK, such as instructions on adding it to your project and getting started, is available
link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android[on GitHub].

JavaDoc APIs for the various modules can be found link:/yubikit-android/JavaDoc/[here].

[NOTE]
======
The pre-release version of the YubiKit Android SDK supported a subset of FIDO2 functionality. In this general availability (GA) version, that FIDO2 module has been removed. We recommend developers use the official link:https://developers.google.com/identity/fido/android/native-apps[FIDO2 API for Android] provided by Google.
