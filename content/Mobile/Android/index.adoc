== Getting Started with Android

Yubico offers two great user experiences on Android employing a simple tap for NFC or a physical connection with USB.

*Authentication via NFC* is supported by the link:https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc[YubiKey 5 NFC].

*Authentication via physical connection* is supported by the NFC keys named above and all of the other YubiKeys with the USB connector (see the link:https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006476-yubikey-support-on-android[YubiKey support on Android article] for a list of these.



=== Yubico Android SDK

Yubico Android SDK (YubiKit for Android) is an Android library provided by Yubico to enable interaction between YubiKeys and Android devices. The library supports NFC-enabled and USB YubiKeys.

YubiKit is a multi-module library with the following components:

* The link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/yubikit/README.md[YubiKit module] provides functionality for detecting whether a YubiKey is plugged into a device or connected to a device over NFC.

* The link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/oath/README.md[OATH module] provides functionality to store OATH TOTP and HOTP credentials and obtain one-time codes.

* The link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/otp/README.md[OTP module] provides implementation classes to obtain Yubico OTPs using either USB or NFC.

* The link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/piv/README.md[PIV module] provides an implementation of the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) interface.

* The link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/management/README.md[MGMT module] provides YubiKey management functionality. This includes a subset of the API for personal customization of the YubiKey and the HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response.

The library includes a demo application implemented in the Kotlin playground, link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/tree/master/YubikitDemo[YubiKit Demo App], which provides a complete example of integrating and using all the features of the library in an Android project.


[NOTE]
======
The pre-release version of the YubiKit Android SDK supported a subset of FIDO2 functionality. In this general availability (GA) version, that FIDO2 module has been removed. We recommend developers use the official link:https://developers.google.com/identity/fido/android/native-apps[FIDO2 API for Android] provided by Google.
