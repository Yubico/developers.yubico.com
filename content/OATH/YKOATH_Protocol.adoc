== YKOATH Protocol Specification
The YKOATH protocol is used to manage and use OATH credentials with a YubiKey
NEO, YubiKey 4, or YubiKey 5. It can be accessed over USB (when the CCID transport is enabled) or
over NFC, using ISO 7816-4 commands as defined in this document.

== General Definitions
=== Instructions
Instructions marked as 'Require Auth' require a successful VALIDATE command to be
performed before they are available, if a validation code is set.

== SELECT INSTRUCTION
Selects the application for use and returns version, ID and a challenge if
authentication is configured (see the validate instruction below).

== SET CODE INSTRUCTION
Configures Authentication.
If length 0 is sent, authentication is removed.
The key to be set is expected to be a user-supplied UTF-8 encoded password
passed through 1000 rounds of PBKDF2 with the ID from select used as salt. 16
bytes of that are used. When configuring authentication you are required to send
an 8 byte challenge and one authentication-response with that key, in order to confirm
that the application and the host software can calculate the same response for that key.

== VALIDATE INSTRUCTION
Validates authentication (mutually).
The challenge for this comes from the SELECT command. The response if computed by
performing the correct HMAC function of that challenge with the correct key.
A new challenge is then sent to the application, together with the response.
The application will then respond with a similar calculation that the host
software can verify.
