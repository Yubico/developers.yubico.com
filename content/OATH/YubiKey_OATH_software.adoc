== YubiKey OATH Software
This page lists software that can read TOTP or HOTP codes from YubiKeys.

NOTE: YubiKeys can also emit HOTP codes via USB without any software.

The link:/yubioath-android[Yubico Authenticator] app lets you read OATH codes
from your YubiKey over NFC.

The link:/yubioath-desktop[Yubico Authenticator for Desktop] lets you read OATH

The ykchalresp command line tool (bundled with

using `ykchalresp -t`. Supports the older slot-based implementation (YubiKey
