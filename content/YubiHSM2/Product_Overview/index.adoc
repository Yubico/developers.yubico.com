== YubiHSM 2 Product Overview

== The YubiHSM 2 device

The YubiHSM 2 is a USB-based, multi-purpose cryptographic device for servers. Its diminutive physical size is ideal for installation directly into internal or external server ports.

== Specifications

=== Cryptographic interfaces

- PKCS#11 API version 2.40
- Yubico Key Storage Provider (KSP) to access Microsoft CNG
- Full access to device capabilities through Yubico's YubiHSM Core Libraries (C, Python)

=== RSA

- 2048, 3072, and 4096 bit keys (with e=65537)
- Signing using PKCS#1v1.5 and PSS
- Decryption using PKCS#1v1.5 and OAEP

=== Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- Curves: secp224r1, secp256r1, secp256k1, secp384r1, secp521r, bp256r1, bp384r1, bp512r1, curve25519
- Signing: ECDSA (all except curve25519), EdDSA (curve25519 only)
- Decryption: ECDH (all except curve25519)

=== Hashing functions

- SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512

=== Key wrap

- Import and export using NIST-approved AES-CCM Wrap with 128, 196, and 256 bit keys

=== Random numbers

- On-chip True Random Number Generator (TRNG) used to seed NIST SP 800-90 AES-256 CTR_DRBG

=== Attestation

- Asymmetric key pairs generated on-device may be attested using a device-specific Yubico attestation key and certificate, or using your own keys and certificates imported into the HSM.

=== Performance

Performance varies depending on usage. The accompanying Software Development Kit includes performance tools that can be used for additional measurements. Example metrics from an otherwise unoccupied YubiHSM 2:

- RSA-2048-PKCS1-SHA256: ~139ms
- RSA-3072-PKCS1-SHA384: ~504ms
- RSA-4096-PKCS1-SHA512: ~852ms
- ECDSA-P256-SHA256: ~73ms
- ECDSA-P384-SHA384: ~120ms
- ECDSA-P521-SHA512: ~210ms
- EdDSA-25519-32Bytes: ~105ms
- EdDSA-25519-64Bytes: ~121ms
- EdDSA-25519-128Bytes: ~137ms
- EdDSA-25519-256Bytes: ~168ms
- EdDSA-25519-512Bytes: ~229ms
- EdDSA-25519-1024Bytes: ~353ms
- AES-(128|192|256)-CCM-Wrap: ~10ms
- HMAC-SHA-(1|256): ~4ms
- HMAC-SHA-(384|512): ~243ms

=== Storage capacity

- All data stored as objects. 256 object slots, 128KB max total
- Stores up to 127 rsa2048 or 93 rsa3072 or 68 rsa4096 or 255 of any elliptic curve type, assuming only one authentication key is present
- Object link:../Concepts/Object.adoc[Types]: Authentication keys (used to establish sessions); Asymmetric private keys; Opaque binary data objects (e.g. x509 certificates); Wrap keys; HMAC keys

=== Management

- Mutual authentication and secure channel between applications and the YubiHSM 2
- M of N unwrap key restore via YubiHSM Setup Tool

=== Physical Characteristics

- Form factor: 'nano' designed for confined spaces such as internal USB ports in servers
- Dimensions: 12mm x 13mm x 3.1mm
- Weight: 1g

=== Host interface

- Universal Serial Bus (USB) 1.x Full Speed (12Mbit/s) Peripheral with bulk interface
