== PKCS#11 with YubiHSM 2

=== Configuration

The link:/yubihsm-shell/yubihsm-pkcs11.html[PKCS#11] module requires a configuration file, default location for this
file is current directory and default name is `yubihsm_pkcs11.conf` using the
environment variable `YUBIHSM_PKCS11_CONF` one can point to a custom location
and name.

Configuration options can also be passed as a string in the `pReserved` field of
`C_Initialize`, using the OpenSSL PKCS#11 engine this can be set in the
`INIT_ARGS` configuration value. This is technically a violation of the PKCS#11
specification (which mandates `pReserved` to be set to `NULL`) and is not supported
by all applications.

Accepted configuration options:

- *connector*: URL pointing at the connector to contact, mandatory
- *debug*: Turn on PKCS#11 debugging, default `off`
- *dinout*: Turn on call tracing, default `off`
- *libdebug*: Turn on debug of libyubihsm, default `off`
- *debug-file*: File to write debug information to, default `stderr`
- *cacert*: File with cacert to verify connector https cert with (not available on Windows)
- *proxy*: Proxy server for reaching the connector (not available on Windows)
- *timeout*: Timeout to use for initial connection to the connector (in seconds), default `5`

A sample configuration file can be found further below.

=== Logging In

All interesting operations through the PKCS#11 interface require a logged-in
session, and one peculiarity of the PKCS#11 interface is that the user
PIN *MUST* be prefixed by the ID (16 bits, in hexadecimal, zero padded if
required) of the corresponding Authentication Key.

Assuming the default Authentication Key with ID `1` and password `password`, the user
PIN would then be `0001password`.

Note that the concept of a Security Officer (SO) is not supported by the device,
and the PIN management functions are not implemented for neither user nor SO.

It is recommended that PIN (Authentication Key) management is performed via the
`yubihsm-shell` utility or the `libyubihsm` functions.

=== Software Operations

`C_Encrypt` and `C_Verify` for Asymmetric Keys are performed in software,
as well as all of the `C_Digest` operations.

== PKCS#11 Attributes

There are a number of attributes defined in PKCS#11 that do not
translate to Capabilities of the YubiHSM 2 device, and are therefore
treated as always having a fixed value.

[options="header"]
|==============================================================================
| PKCS#11 | YubiHSM 2 | Rationale
| CKA_PRIVATE | CK_TRUE | Login is always required
| CKA_DESTROYABLE | CK_TRUE | Objects can always be deleted from the device
| CKA_MODIFIABLE | CK_FALSE | Objects are immutable on the device
| CKA_COPYABLE | CK_FALSE | Objects are immutable on the device
| CKA_SENSITIVE | CK_TRUE | All objects are sensitive
| CKA_ALWAYS_SENSITIVE | CK_TRUE | Objects are immutable on the device
|==============================================================================

=== Capabilities and Domains

Objects created via the PKCS#11 module inherit the Domains of the Authentication Key
used to establish the session.
The Domains can not be changed, or modified via the module.

Object Capabilities are set on creation, depending on their Type, e.g.
an RSA signing key (`CKK_RSA`) created via `C_CreateObject` with the
attribute `CKA_SIGN` set will have the following Capabilities set
`sign-pkcs,sign-pss`.

Similarly for EC (`CKK_EC`), the key would have
`sign-ecdsa` set.

See the following tables for mappings:

[options="header"]
|==============================================================================
| PKCS#11 | RSA (CKK_RSA) | EC (CKK_EC) | Wrap (CKK_YUBICO_AES*_CCM_WRAP) | HMAC (CKK_SHA*_HMAC)

| CKA_VERIFY | N/A | N/A | N/A | verify-hmac

| CKA_DECRYPT | decrypt-pkcs,decrypt-oaep | N/A | unwrap-data | N/A
| CKA_DERIVE | N/A | derive-ecdh | N/A | N/A
| CKA_WRAP | N/A | N/A | export-wrapped | N/A
| CKA_UNWRAP | N/A | N/A | import-wrapped | N/A
| CKA_EXTRACTABLE | export-under-wrap | export-under-wrap | export-under-wrap | export-under-wrap

implemented and what it maps to.

== PKCS#11 Configuration

=== Configuration File Sample

Below is a sample of a `yubihsm_pkcs11.conf` configuration file.

[source,cfg]
----
# This is a sample configuration file for the YubiHSM PKCS#11 module
# Uncomment the various options as needed

# URL of the connector to use. This can be a comma-separated list
connector = http://127.0.0.1:12345

# Enables general debug output in the module
#
# debug

# Enables function tracing (ingress/egress) debug output in the module
#
# dinout

# Enables libyubihsm debug output in the module
#
# libdebug

# Redirects the debug output to a specific file. The file is created
# if it does not exist. The content is appended
#
# debug-file = /tmp/yubihsm_pkcs11_debug

# CA certificate to use for HTTPS validation. Point this variable to
# a file containing one or more certificates to use when verifying
# a peer. Currently not supported on Windows
#
# cacert = /tmp/cacert.pem

# Proxy server to use for the connector
# Currently not supported on Windows
#
# proxy = http://proxyserver.local.com:8080

# Timeout in seconds to use for the initial connection to the connector
# timeout = 5
----

=== INIT_ARGS Sample

Below is a sample of using the `INIT_ARGS` configuration with an `openssl.cnf` file.

[source,cfg]
----
openssl_conf = openssl_init

[openssl_init]
engines = engine_section

[engine_section]
pkcs11 = pkcs11_section

[pkcs11_section]
engine_id = pkcs11
dynamic_path = /path/to/engine_pkcs11.so
MODULE_PATH = /path/to/yubihsm_pkcs11.so
INIT_ARGS = connector=http://127.0.0.1:12345 debug
init = 0
----

NOTE: OpenSSL 1.1 will auto-load modules present in the system engine directory
(like `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/engines-1.1`) so the `dynamic_path` line has to
be dropped there. The error shown will mention "conflicting engine id".
