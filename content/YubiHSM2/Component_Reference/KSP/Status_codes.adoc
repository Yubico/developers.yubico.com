== Status Codes

The YubiHSM software components have a standard set of status codes to report
the status of an HSM operation.  To comply with the expectations of specific
platforms, these status codes are converted to the appropriate API status code.

Currently, this translation is only performed for the Windows Key Storage
Provider. The error codes, their meanings and translated values are as follows:

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
