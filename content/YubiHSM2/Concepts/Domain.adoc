== Domain

Objects can be organized so that they can not be addressed by independent applications running on the same device. This is achieved by specifying the Object's Domains.

A Domain is a logical partition and can be conceptually mapped to a container. In a YubiHSM 2 there are `16` independent Domains and an Object can belong to one or more. The role that Domains play when trying to access an Object is explained in the link:Effective_Capabilities.adoc[Effective Capabilities] page. For now suffice it to say that a user has to have access to at least one of the Object's Domains in order to use it.

== Protocol Details

Domains are encoded as 16-bit values, where each one is represented by a bit
