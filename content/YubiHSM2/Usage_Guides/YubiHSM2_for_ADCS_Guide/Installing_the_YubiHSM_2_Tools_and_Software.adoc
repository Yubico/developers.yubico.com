== Installing the YubiHSM 2 Tools and Software

To complete the procedures in this guide, install the YubiHSM 2 tools and software that will be needed for this.

=== About the YubiHSM Software
The following YubiHSM pieces of software are used in this guide. They are included as part of the
archive file you downloaded.

:YubiHSM Connector: Facilitates communication between the YubiHSM 2 and applications that use it. Must always be running.

:YubiHSM Shell yubihsm-shell.exe: The administrative command line tool used to interact with and configure the YubiHSM 2 device.

:YubiHSM Setup yubihsm-setup.exe: Helps with setting up a device for specific use cases. Currently supports setting up for use with KSP/ADCS.

:YubiHSM Key Storage Provider (KSP): Acts like a “driver” for the device on Windows and allows it to work with applications that leverage Microsoft’s cryptographic interface, such as Active Directory Certificate Services.


=== Installation

A generic prompt, `*$*`, is used in command line examples in this document. Depending on your command line application, your prompt may be different.


*Step 1* Unzip the downloaded link:https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/[archives of the SDK] containing the YubiHSM libraries and tools and move the contents to an appropriate location.

*Step 2* On your Windows system, run both installers:

         * `yubihsm-cngprovider-windows-amd64.msi` (YubiHSM Key Storage Provider)
         * `yubihsm-connector-windows-amd64.msi` (YubiHSM Connector for Windows)


=== Verifying the Default Configuration of the YubiHSM 2

The YubiHSM 2 device comes with a single factory-installed authentication key whose default password is `password`. As part of the configuration in this guide, this default authentication key will be destroyed. If the YubiHSM 2 is reset to its default configuration, any non factory-installed objects stored on it are also destroyed. Reset instructions can be found in link:../Factory_reset.adoc[Factory Reset].

We reiterate that you will need two YubiHSM 2 devices to complete all steps of this guide, because you will be deploying the first device and creating a backup of all key material on the second device.

To ensure that neither of the YubiHSM 2 devices have been tampered with, verify that they still have the default configuration by following the steps below:

*Step 1* Do one of the following:

* If the application that calls the YubiHSM Connector is *running on a local host*, start the Connector with the command `yubihsm-connector` without additional parameters. In Windows Server 2012 SP2 or higher, `yubihsm-connector.exe` is located in `C:\Program Files\YubiHSM Connector\`.

* If the application is *running on a VM or a different server*, start the YubiHSM Connector on the host operating system in networking mode. For example, if the host machine’s IP address is 192.168.100.252, launch the Connector on the host OS with the command `yubihsm-connector -l 192.168.100.252:12345`

[TIP]
=====
For testing or debugging the YubiHSM Connector, the flag `-d` can be set.
=====

*Step 2* To gain shell access to the YubiHSM 2, launch the YubiHSM Shell program by opening a Command Prompt and running the command `yubihsm-shell`. If a networked Connector is used, set the parameter `--connect <connector URL>`, for example:

`$ yubihsm-shell --connector http://192.168.100.252:12345`

[TIP]
=====
For testing or debugging the YubiHSM Shell, the flag `-d` can be set.
=====

*Step 3* To connect to the YubiHSM 2, at the `yubihsm` command line, type `connect`. A message saying that you have a successful connection is displayed.

*Step 4* To open a session with the YubiHSM 2, type `session open 1` (where `1` is the ID of the default authentication key pre-installed on the device).

*Step 5* Type in the default password: `password`. A message confirming  that the session has been set up successfully is displayed.

*Step 6* You now have an administrative connection to the YubiHSM 2 and you can list the objects available by typing `list objects 0` and pressing *Enter*. Your results should be similar to the following:

`id: 0x0001, type: authentication-key, sequence: 0`

To exit, type `quit`.
