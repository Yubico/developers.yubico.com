== Install the YubiHSM 2 Tools and Software

To complete the procedures in this guide, install the YubiHSM 2 tools and software that will be needed for this.

[TIP]
=====
A generic prompt, `*$*`, is used in command line examples in this document. Depending on your command line application, your prompt may be different.
=====

*Step 1* Unzip the downloaded link:../../Releases/[archives of the SDK] containing the YubiHSM libraries and tools and move the contents to an appropriate location.

*Step 2* On your Windows system, run both installers:

* `yubihsm-cngprovider-windows-amd64.msi` (YubiHSM Key Storage Provider)
* `yubihsm-connector-windows-amd64.msi` (YubiHSM Connector for Windows)


=== Default YubiHSM 2 Default Device Configuration

The YubiHSM 2 device comes with a single factory-installed authentication key whose default password is `password`. As part of the configuration in this guide, this default authentication key will be destroyed. If the YubiHSM 2 is reset to its default configuration, any non factory-installed objects stored on it are also destroyed. Reset instructions can be found in link:../Factory_reset.adoc[Factory Reset].

To ensure that the YubiHSM 2 has not been tampered with, verify that it still has the default configuration by following the steps below:

*Step 1* Do one of the following:

* If the application that calls the YubiHSM Connector is *running on a local host*, start the Connector with the command `yubihsm-connector` without additional parameters. In Windows Server 2012 SP2 or higher, `yubihsm-connector.exe` is located in `C:\Program Files\YubiHSM Connector\`.

* If the application is *running on a VM or a different server*, start the YubiHSM Connector on the host operating system in networking mode. For example, if the host machineâ€™s IP address is 192.168.100.252, launch the Connector on the host OS with the command `yubihsm-connector -l 192.168.100.252:12345`

[TIP]
=====
For testing or debugging the YubiHSM Connector, the flag `-d` can be set.
=====

*Step 2* To gain shell access to the YubiHSM 2, launch the YubiHSM Shell program by opening a Command Prompt and running the command `yubihsm-shell`. If a networked Connector is used, set the parameter `--connect <connector URL>`, for example:

`$ yubihsm-shell --connector http://192.168.100.252:12345`

[TIP]
=====
For testing or debugging the YubiHSM Shell, the flag `-d` can be set.
=====

*Step 3* To connect to the YubiHSM 2, at the `yubihsm` command line, type `connect`. A message saying that you have a successful connection is displayed.

*Step 4* To open a session with the YubiHSM 2, type `session open 1` (where `1` is the ID of the default authentication key pre-installed on the device).

*Step 5* Type in the default password: `password`. A message confirming  that the session has been set up successfully is displayed.

*Step 6* You now have an administrative connection to the YubiHSM 2 and you can list the objects available by typing `list objects 0` and pressing *Enter*. Your results should be similar to the following:

`id: 0x0001, type: authentication-key, sequence: 0`

To exit, type `quit`.
