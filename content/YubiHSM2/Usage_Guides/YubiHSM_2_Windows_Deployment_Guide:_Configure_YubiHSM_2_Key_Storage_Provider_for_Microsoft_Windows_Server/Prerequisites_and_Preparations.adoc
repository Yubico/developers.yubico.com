== Prerequisites and Preparations

The audience of this document is an experienced systems administrator with a good understanding of Microsoft Windows Server management. In addition, it is helpful to be familiar with the terminology, software, and tools specific to YubiHSM 2. As a primer for these, refer to the Terminology table in link:Getting_Help.adoc[Getting Help].

In order to follow the steps provided in this guide, the following prerequisites must be met:

* Access to Microsoft Windows Server 2012 SP2 or higher, installed in a secure computer network. The system administrator must have elevated system privileges.

* The YubiHSM 2 SDK  downloaded from https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/ [the Yubico YubiHSM 2 Release page] and available on the system to be used. Installation instructions are given in the following.

* Two (2) YubiHSM 2 devices, one for deployment and one for backup in hardware.

* Key custodians, if your organization policies require them for the YubiHSM 2 deployment. For more information about key custodians and the associated ‘M of N’ key shares, see "Key Splitting and Key Custodians" below.

[IMPORTANT]
===========
Although it is possible to configure the YubiHSM 2 on a networked machine, to safeguard its integrity, it is recommended that its configuration be performed on a fresh system in an air-gapped environment, i.e., the steps in this guide should be performed on a stand-alone computer with both Windows Server 2012 SP2 or higher and the YubiHSM 2 software installed. And we recommend that you do not store keys - even under wrap - on network-accessible or otherwise compromisable storage media.

=== Key Splitting and Key Custodians

The preferred method for backing up the YubiHSM 2 keys calls for key splitting and restoring or regenerating, often referred to as setting up an **'M of n’** scheme (https://cs.jhu.edu/~sdoshi/crypto/papers/shamirturing.pdf[Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS)]). This process ensures no individual can export key material from the YubiHSM 2, and provides a way to control the import of key material that has been exported under wrap from one device into other devices. For example, you would export and import objects for backup purposes, as described in link:Back_Up_and_Restore_Key_Material.adoc[Back Up and Restore Key Material].

The key that is split among a predetermined number (**n**) of **key custodians** (also known as key shareholders) is known as the wrap key. Each custodian receives their own unique share. In order to use the key, a minimum number of shares (**m**) must be present so that the key can be regenerated (sometimes called "rejoined"). This minimum number of custodians is called the **privacy threshold**. If this threshold is not attained, the wrap key cannot be regenerated. This minimum number, **‘n’**, should be larger than one.

The exact number of key shares and the privacy threshold are determined by the requirements of your organization. If your organization has policies in place that define how this procedure should be performed, be sure you know these policies before proceeding. You should also have a predetermined practice in place specifying both:

* How the key shares must be recorded (written on paper, photographed, locally printed, or some other means) and
* How they must be stored between uses (for example, offsite archive, safety deposit box, sealed envelope).

The YubiHSM Setup Tool enables you to perform the key splitting and assigning of shares to key custodians. To carry out the setup process, you need to know who the wrap key custodians will be. During setup, all key custodians must be physically present to record their shares. Exact instructions for key splitting and assigning of shares are given in link:Configure_the_Primary_YubiHSM_2_Device[Configure the Primary YubiHSM 2 Device].
