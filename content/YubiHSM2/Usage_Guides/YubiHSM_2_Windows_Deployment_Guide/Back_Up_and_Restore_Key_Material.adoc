== Back Up and Restore Key Material

We strongly recommend making a backup copy of all production objects residing on your production devices, particularly once the asymmetric key has been generated on the YubiHSM 2. If there is a hardware failure of the production device, having a backup ensures that you can resume operations quickly. The backup process will result in two identical YubiHSM 2 devices with the same number of objects, keys, labels, etc.

Making specific recommendations for governance of your critical key material is out of scope for this guide. Make sure to design these security procedures to meet the requirements of your organization - and then document them carefully.


=== Back Up the YubiHSM 2

The procedure described in this section is appropriate for testing and for smaller installations. For larger and/or more complex installations such as:

* Those whose setup did not involve the YubiHSM Setup program
* When moving the YubiHSM 2 device from one server to another

Review the information on the Yubico developers’ website at link:../../Backup_and_Restore/[Backup and Restore] to determine whether the procedures there might be more appropriate for your situation.

The link:../../Backup_and_Restore/[backup] of the primary YubiHSM 2 contains duplicates of all the objects stored on the primary device. These objects are available using the same application authentication key as the one used for the primary YubiHSM 2. The objects are exported under wrap. This guide gives instructions for duplicating the following on the secondary device:

* Wrap key (previously created with ID `2`),
* Application authentication key (ID `3`),
* Audit key (ID `4`) (if created previously)
* Certificate Authority (CA) root key.

The factory-installed authentication key (ID `1`) on the secondary device will be destroyed. You will need assistance from the wrap key custodians to provide their respective wrap key shares, if applicable. In the example we used in this guide, 2 out of the 3 custodians/shares must be available.

Restoring a device should be performed in an air-gapped environment to guarantee integrity.


==== Overview of Procedure

The backup procedure consists of the following steps, which are described in detail in the following.

1. Locate the wrapped key material that was previously exported in step 10 of link:../Configure_the_Primary_YubiHSM_2_Device.adoc[Procedure: Configuring Primary YubiHSM 2]. If it has not yet been exported, carry out the aforementioned step.

2. Set up communication between the YubiHSM 2 tools and the secondary (backup) YubiHSM 2 device.

3. Start the configuration process and authenticate to the secondary YubiHSM 2 device.

4. Restore the key material onto a secondary YubiHSM 2 device.

=== Restore Keys on the Secondary YubiHSM 2 Device

*Step 1*: Verify that all the keys that were previously exported from the primary YubiHSM 2 under wrap are located in a directory to which you have read access.

If the necessary keys are not yet all available on disk, you can export the keys under wrap by running the following command:

`$ yubihsm-setup dump`

The YubiHSM Setup tool looks for files with the .yhw file extension in the current working directory and attempts to read and import them into the YubiHSM 2 device. The wrap key will be imported as a result of providing the wrap key shares to the tool.

For example, the following wrapped key files may be present:

* `0x0003-AuthenticationKey.yhw` (Application authentication key under wrap)

* `0x0004-AuthenticationKey.yhw` (Audit authentication key under wrap)

* `0x427a-Opaque.yhw`			(Certificate under wrap)

* `0x427a-AsymmetricKey.yhw`		(Private asymmetric key under wrap)

TIP: If the initial authentication key (by default available as ID 0x0001) has been deleted, the new authentication application key should be identified with the flag yubihsm-setup --authkey. For example:

`$ yubihsm-setup --authkey 0x0003 dump`

*Step 2*: To begin the process of restoring the data onto the secondary YubiHSM 2, if the primary YubiHSM 2 device is inserted into your computer, remove it and insert the secondary device.

*Step 3*: In your Command Prompt in the directory containing the backed up *.yhw files, run YubiHSM Setup with the argument restore:

`$ yubihsm-setup restore`

TIP: For *test purposes* you can set the `yubihsm-setup -d` flag to keep the default
authentication-key with the administrative privileges; this will allow you to delete keys on
the YubiHSM 2 for test purposes only. For *production purposes*, however, the
`yubihsm-setup` command must be executed without the `-d` flag to ensure that the
factory preset authentication key is properly deleted on the YubiHSM 2 device.

*Step 4*: To start the YubiHSM Setup process, type the default authentication key password password. A confirmation message is displayed, announcing that the default authentication key was used and that you are authenticated to the YubiHSM 2 device:

`Using authentication key 0x0001`

You will now start the restore procedure, which involves providing the number of wrap key
shares required by the privacy threshold defined when setting up the primary device.

*Step 5*: When prompted, type the number of shares required by the privacy threshold. In the example used in this guide, we have specified that two shares are required to regenerate the key. These must be present in order to proceed.

*Step 6*: When prompted for share number 1, the wrap key custodian holding the first share inputs this information. A message is displayed confirming that the share was received:

`Received share 2-1WWmTQj5PHGJQ4H9Y2ouURm8m75QkDOeYzFzOX1VyMpAO…``

*Step 7*: Continue to have each wrap key custodian enter the share information for each of the wrap key shares required to rejoin the key share. Once a sufficient number of wrap key shares have been inserted by the wrap key custodians, a final message is displayed:

`Stored wrap key with ID 0x0002 on the device`

_Note: The ID of the wrap key on the secondary device is the same as the ID of the wrap key on the primary device._

*Step 8*: Once the wrap key has been stored on the secondary device, the YubiHSM Setup program reads the files containing the application authentication key, the CA root key, and, if applicable, the audit key, all of which were saved to file under wrap during the configuration of the primary device.

....
reading ./0x0004.yhw
Successfully imported object Authkey, with ID 0x0004
reading ./0x0003.yhw
Successfully imported object Authkey, with ID 0x0003
reading ./0x427a-AsymmetricKey.yhw
Successfully imported object Asymmetric, with ID 0x427a
reading ./0x427a-Opaque.yhw
Successfully imported object Opaque, with ID 0x427a
....

*Step 9*: If there are files containing wrapped objects with the `*.yhw` file extension in this directory that were exported with a wrap key other than the one reconstituted by the shares here, the setup tool attempts to read those too, but will fail gracefully. The setup tool restores only the files it can decrypt.

*Step 10*: The restore process finishes and the setup tool informs you that the default factory-installed authentication key has been deleted.

....
Previous authentication key 0x0001 deleted

All done
....

Finally, the YubiHSM Setup application exits.


=== Confirm the Duplicated YubiHSM 2

You now have a duplicate of the device configured with the three key objects you created on the primary device earlier. Confirm that these are identical to those on the primary device that was configured earlier.

*Step 1*: In your Command Prompt, run the YubiHSM Shell program:

`$ yubihsm-shell`

*Step 2*: To connect to the YubiHSM 2, at the `yubihsm` prompt, type `connect` and press *Enter*. A message confirming that you have a successful connection is displayed.

*Step 3*: To open a session with the YubiHSM 2, type `session open 3` (where `3` is the ID for your application authentication key) and press *Enter*.

*Step 4* Type in the password for the application authentication key. A  message confirming that the session has been set up successfully is displayed.

*Step 5* To list the objects, type `list objects 0` (or instead of `0` the session number that was given to you in step 4). Verify that the secondary device now contains all of the key material that you intended to restore.

Depending on the order in which the keys under wrap were imported, the enumerated keys on the secondary device may not be listed in the same sequence as they are on the primary device when the `list` command is used. This has no practical implication and the object IDs are identical on the two devices.

If you have verified that the secondary device now contains all of the key material that you intended to restore, you should now remove the keys under wrap currently on file. The computer’s hard drive can be erased too.
