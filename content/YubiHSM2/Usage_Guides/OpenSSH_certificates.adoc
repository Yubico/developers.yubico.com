== OpenSSH Certificates

OpenSSH supports a proprietary version of certificates that allow
simple login to hosts.

=== Traditional Method

The usual way to enable a user `U` to access a specific host `H` using
SSH is to copy the public key of `U` in a file on `H` (typically
called `authorized_keys`).

This method suffers from a lack of generality. If another user `U'`
were to be given access to `H`, their public key should also be copied
in that same file. At the same time, if `U` were to be given access to
a different host `H'`, their public key would have to be added to an
equivalent file on that host.

While various automatic provisioning systems have been devised, those
still represent a workaround rather than a solution to the problem.

=== OpenSSH CA

Since version `5.4` (released 2010-03-08) OpenSSH has had support for
so-called _OpenSSH Certificates_.

By using these, only one OpenSSH CA public key has to be copied onto
the target host. At that point any user can be granted access to any
such host by giving them a file that contains the following
information: their own public key, a validity period, a list of
usernames that the user is allowed to login as and a digital signature
over the whole content created using the private key of an SSH CA.

This file, the SSH Certificate, is then automatically presented to
the SSH server by the SSH client of the user as part of the login
process.

=== OpenSSH Certificates with YubiHSM 2

The private key of an SSH CA is a regular private key and can be stored
on a YubiHSM 2. OpenSSH has builtin support for signing SSH Certificates
using CA private keys that reside on a hardware token through the PKCS#11
interface.

The YubiHSM 2 also has specific support for signing SSH Certificates
using an RSA CA key.  This guide will also describe how to leverage
that.

==== Example: OpenSSH builtin support for Signing SSH certificates

Signing SSH certificates is performed with OpenSSH's `ssh-keygen`
command using the `-s ca_key` option.  The `ca_key` specifies the
key file containing the signing key.  The signing key can be stored
in an HSM, in which case the key file only contains the public part
of the signing key.  The public key is used to locate the corresponding
private key on the HSM through the PKCS#11 interface.  The PKCS#11
module to use is specified with the `-D` option.

As an example, create an SSH CA key on the HSM, export the CA public
key, and convert the public key into PKCS8 format for use with
OpenSSH:

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -a generate-asymmetric-key  --authkey=0x0001 -p password -i 0x000a -l "SSH_CA_Key" -c "sign-pkcs" -A rsa2048
Using default connector URL: http://127.0.0.1:12345
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds
Created session 1
Generated Asymmetric key 0x000a
$ yubihsm-shell -p password --authkey=0x0001 -a get-public-key -i 0x000a --out ca_pub.pem
Using default connector URL: http://127.0.0.1:12345
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds
Created session 1
$ ssh-keygen -i -f ca_pub.pem -m PKCS8 > ca.pub
----

Note that the CA key needs capability `sign-pkcs` in order to sign
SSH pubkeys.

Next, sign the user's pubkey in the file `id_rsa.pub`, using the
signing key stored in the HSM

[source, bash]
----
$ ssh-keygen -s ca.pub -D /usr/local/lib/pkcs11/yubihsm_pkcs11.dylib -I key_id id_rsa.pub
Enter PIN for 'YubiHSM': 
Signed user key id_rsa-cert.pub: id "key_id" serial 0 valid forever
----

Note that the PIN needs to be prefixed with the ID of the
authentication-key in order for `ssh-keygen` to authenticate.

The signed SSH certificate is generated in the file `id_rsa-cert.pub`

=== Signing SSH Certificate Requests

Instead of directly signing a user's SSH pubkey directly, the YubiHSM 2
can also be used to sign SSH pubkeys only when a number of conditions
are met.  This scenario is discussed in the rest of this document.

=== High-level Description and components

A YubiHSM 2 device is able to sign OpenSSH public keys when those are
submitted to the device as part of a specific format that we call
`OpenSSH Certificate Request`.

Such a request is granted (i.e. the signature is computed and
released), if and only if the following two requirements are
fulfilled:

 - the user who sends the request to the device has the right
   privileges to access the OpenSSH CA private key on the device;
 - the OpenSSH Certificate Request meets a series of
   pre-defined constraints.

The first requirement is fulfilled by making sure that the user
submitting the request (who may not be the same one who generates
the request) can establish a Session with the device through an
Authentication Key that has access to the necessary Domains and has
the necessary Capability set.

The second requirement is fulfilled by encoding those pre-defined
constraints in an object with Type `Template` and Algorithm `SSH
Template`.

=== SSH Template

An `SSH Template` is a binary object that can be used to restrict how
and when an SSH CA private key should be used to sign SSH Certificate
Requests.

This is a binary object that encodes a series of constraints. Its
format is a collection of Tag-Length-Value tuples whose meaning is
described below:

[options="header"]
|===
| Tag Value | Tag Description |
| 0x01 | Timestamp key algorithm |
| 0x02 | Timestamp public key |
| 0x03 | CA key white-list |
| 0x04 | Not before |
| 0x05 | Not after |
| 0x06 | Principals black-list |
|===

The individual tags are further explained below.

==== Timestamp Key Algorithm

The link:../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] of the public key used to
verify timestamp signatures.

==== Timestamp Public Key

The public key used to verify timestamp signatures.

==== CA Key White-list

The list of link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object IDs] describing
which Asymmetric Keys can be used with this template.

==== Not Before

The `Not Before` time offset to be applied to the current time. If a
request contains a time value that is before this computed timestamp,
an error will be returned.

==== Not After

The `Not After` time offset to be applied to the current time. If a
request contains a time value that is after this computed timestamp,
an error will be returned.

==== Principals Black-list

The `nul`-separated, `nul`-terminated list of Principals (user names) for which a
certificate will not be issued.

==== Example template

A hex-dump of an example template file is shown below:

----
01 0001 09
02 0100 cb2702...d71081f1d1
03 0002 000a
04 0004 000012c0
05 0004 00008ca0
06 0005 726f6f7400
----

This template file contains, in order:

- Timestamp Key Algorithm 9 (RSA 2048)
- Timestamp public key (256 bytes)
- CA Key whitelist containing the single Key ID 0x000a
- A Not before offset of 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- A Not after offset of 36000 seconds (10 hours)
- A principal blacklist containing the principal `root`

Although not officially supported, templates can be generated using 
link:https://github.com/YubicoLabs/yubihsm-ssh-tool[yubihsm-ssh-tool].

For instance, the above template file and the embedded timestamp
key are generated using:

[source, bash]
----
$ openssl genrsa -out timestamp.pem
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.................................+++
........................................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
$ openssl rsa -pubout -in timestamp.pem -out timestamp_pub.pem
writing RSA key
$ pipenv run yubihsm-ssh-tool templ -T timestamp_pub.pem -k 10 -b 300 -a 36000 -p root
----

Here, the file `timestamp_pub.pem` contains the timestamp certificate
public key, the CA key ID is 10, certificates should only be issued
if their validity is at most 5 minutes in the past (to accomodate
for clock skew) and at most 10 hours in the future. Also, certificates
for user `root` are not allowed.

=== SSH Certificate Request

An SSH certificate format is defined by OpenSSH but it is not too
dissimilar from an X.509 certificate. At its core it is a collection
of attributes, a time period, a public key and a signature over all
the data.

An SSH Certificate Request is the set of information that must be sent
to a YubiHSM 2 so that it can generate the aforementioned signature.
This consists of all the data present in the certificate (excluding
the signature).

For a description, see
the `ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com` key format in the 
link:https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/PROTOCOL.certkeys[the OpenSSH specs].

==== Signing an SSH Certificate Request

Once an SSH Template has been stored on the YubiHSM 2 and an SSH
Certificate Request has been created, it can be sent to the device for
signing.

This is done by issuing the
link:../Commands/Sign_Ssh_Certificate.adoc[Sign SSH Certificate]
Command. The parameters required are:

- the link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the SSH CA key
  which has already been stored on the device

- the link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the SSH
  Template to use in order to validate the request

- the link:../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] to use to produce the
  certificate signature

- the timestamp with the definition of `Now`

- the signature `S~T~` over the SSH Certificate Request and the
  timestamp

- the SSH Certificate Request

After the command is issued, the following steps take place in the
YubiHSM 2. First the the signature `S~T~` is verified using the public
key present within the specified SSH Template. If the verification is
successful, the value of `Now` is recorded. Next the SSH Certificate
Request is parsed to extract the `Not Before` and `Not After`
timestamps together with the list of Principals. The following checks
are then performed:

- the ID of the SSH CA key must appear in the SSH CA key white-list
  present in the SSH Template

- the `Not Before` timestamp in the SSH Certificate Request must be
  greater than or equal to `Now` plus the `Not Before` offset
  specified in the SSH Template

- the `Not After` timestamp in the SSH Certificate Request must be
  less than or equal to `Now` plus the `Not After` offset specified in
  the SSH Template

- none of the Principals specified in the SSH Certificate Request must
  appear in the Principals black-list SSH Template

If all the constraints were fulfilled, the YubiHSM 2 will produce a
signature using the Algorithm specified in the command. This signature
can be appended to the SSH Certificate Request to produce a valid SSH
Certificate.

==== Example request

Although not officially supported, requests can be generated using 
link:https://github.com/YubicoLabs/yubihsm-ssh-tool[yubihsm-ssh-tool]:

[source, bash]
----
$ pipenv run yubihsm-ssh-tool req -s ca_pub.pem -t timestamp.pem -I user-identity -n username -V -5h:+5h id_rsa.pub
----

==== Example: Signing SSH certificates using templates and signing requests

Below is an example of signing SSH certificates using templates and
certificate requests.

Again, start with creating an SSH CA key on the HSM, and export the
CA public key:

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -a generate-asymmetric-key  --authkey=0x0001 -p password -i 10 -l "SSH_CA_Key" -c "sign-ssh-certificate" -A rsa2048
Using default connector URL: http://127.0.0.1:12345
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds
Created session 1
Generated Asymmetric key 0x000a
$ yubihsm-shell -p password --authkey=0x0001 -a get-public-key -i 10 --out ca_pub.pem
Using default connector URL: http://127.0.0.1:12345
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds
Created session 1
----

Note that this time, the CA key needs capability `sign-ssh-certificate`
in order to sign SSH certificate signing requests.

Next, create the template file and store the template in the HSM
as an object of type `template-ssh` with object ID 20 and label
`SSH_Template`:

[source, bash]
----
$ pipenv run yubihsm-ssh-tool templ -T timestamp_pub.pem -k 10 -b 36000 -a 36000 -p root
$ yubihsm-shell -a put-template -p password -i 20 -l "SSH_Template" -A template-ssh --in templ.dat
Using default connector URL: http://127.0.0.1:12345
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds
Created session 1
Stored Template object 0x0014
----

Generate a certificate signing request for user `username`:

[source, bash]
----
$ pipenv run yubihsm-ssh-tool req -s ca_pub.pem -t timestamp.pem -I user-identity -n username -V -5h:+5h id_rsa.pub
Hash is: b'95dd317189b5e392481de896e7f111228b76d6efe3daa344c2da2819927a05cb'
----

Sign the certificate request using the CA key on the HSM:

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -a sign-ssh-certificate -p password -i 10 --template-id 20 -A rsa-pkcs1-sha256 --in req.dat --out id_rsa-cert.pub
Using default connector URL: http://127.0.0.1:12345
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds
Created session 1
----

The signed SSH certificate is generated in the file `id_rsa-cert.pub`

==== Example: constraint violation

To illustrate what happens when the constraints specified in the
certificate template are violated, for instance when a certificate
is requested for the `root` user:

[source, bash]
----
$ pipenv run yubihsm-ssh-tool req -s ca_pub.pem -t timestamp.pem -I user-identity -n root -V -5h:+5h id_rsa.pub
Hash is: b'b75d30392a5ea5887affceb593154d2cc860f76f7bbc82757ec3fa20cd2a4d63'
$ yubihsm-shell -a sign-ssh-certificate -p password -i 10 --template-id 20 -A rsa-pkcs1-sha256 --in req.dat --out id_rsa-cert.pub
Using default connector URL: http://127.0.0.1:12345
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds
Created session 1
Failed to get certificate signature: SSH CA constraint violation
Unable to get ssh certificate
----

=== Final notes

The certificate template is used to put restrictions on the SSH certificates issued.
It is also recommended to restrict the privileges of the client submitting the signing requests.
This can be done by stripping the capabilities of both the signing key and
the authentication key that the client uses to connect to the HSM.
