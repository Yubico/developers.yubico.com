== SET OPTION

Set a device-global option.

== Description

Set device-global options that affect general behavior. Each invocation
of this command sets a single option, which is represented as a
TAG-LENGTH-VALUE (TLV).

== Shell Example

Turn off audit logging for Sign HMAC (command `53`) and Verify HMAC (command `5c`):

  yubihsm> put option 0 command-audit 53005c00

== Protocol Details

=== Command

|===============
|T~c~ = 0x4f
|L~c~ = 3 + L~o~
|V~c~ = T~O~
|===============

T~o~ := The TLV encoding of the selected option

L~o~ := The option-specific length in bytes

The options currently supported are the following:

TAG is 1 byte

LENGTH is 2 bytes

VALUE is L~o~ bytes

Values:

|OFF | 0x00 | Disabled
|ON  | 0x01 | Enabled
|FIX | 0x02 | Enabled, only possible to turn off through factory reset

The defined options are as follows:

With `Force audit` set, the device will refuse operations as long as
the link:../Concepts/Logs.adoc[Log Store] is full. It takes a `1` byte
value option.

`Command audit` can be used to toggle whether a specific
command should be logged, this takes tuples of command number and option
value.

`Algorithm toggle` allows the user to selectively disable individual
algorithms for the whole device. This option can only be toggled on a
freshly reset device, i.e. one with only the default Authentication
Key. This takes a tuple of algorithm number and option value.

`FIPS mode` is only available on
link:https://www.yubico.com/products/hardware-security-module/[FIPS
devices] and can only be toggled on a freshly reset device, i.e. one
with only the default Authentication Key present. It disables
algorithms that are not allowed by FIPS 140. This step is required as
part of setting the device in the approved mode of operation, together
with deleting the default Authentication Key (see
link:https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/documents/security-policies/140sp3916.pdf[Section
3.2] of the YubiHSM FIPS Security Policy).
