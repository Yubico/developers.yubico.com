== Protocol Details

=== Command

|=======================
|T~c~ = 0x5d
|L~c~ = 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 256 + L~R~
|V~c~ = I \|\| T \|\| A \|\| N \|\| S \|\| R
|=======================

Sign and SSH Certificate by using the given Asymmetric Key and SSH Template.

I := link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the Asymmetric Key (2 bytes)

T := link:../Concepts/Object_ID.adoc[Object ID] of the SSH Template (2 bytes)

A := link:../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] (1 byte)

N := Timestamp with the definition of `Now` (4 bytes)

S := Signature over the request and timestamp (256 bytes)

R := Request (L~R~ bytes)

=== Response

|===========
|T~r~ = 0xd6
|L~r~ = L~S~
|V~r~ = S
