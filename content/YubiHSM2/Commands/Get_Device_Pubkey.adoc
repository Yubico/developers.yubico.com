== Protocol Details

=== Command

|===============
|T~c~ = 0x0a
|L~c~ = 0
|V~c~ = Ã˜
|===============

=== Response

|==================================================
|T~r~ = 0x8a
|L~r~ = 1 + 64
|V~r~ = A \|\| K
|==================================================

A := link:../Concepts/Algorithms.adoc[Algorithm] (1 byte)

K := Uncompressed EC-P256 public key (64 bytes)

The algorithm will currently always be `ec-p256-yubico-authentication`.

The uncompressed EC key marker is omitted (hence the 64 bytes), similarly to how other EC keys are handled.
