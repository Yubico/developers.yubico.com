=== Question: My device, iOS version, and YubiKey support WebAuthn(FIDO2) but the key is not responding to my touch.

*Answer*: If you are trying to register a key for the first time with a service, you may have encountered one of the link:Known_Issues.adoc[Known Issues] that we are working with Apple on resolving. Table 1 in link:Security_Key_Compatibility.adoc[Security Key Compatibility] shows that nearly all FIDO2/WebAuthn Authentication flows will work. *Workaround*: Register the YubiKey with a service on a supported desktop browser. All subsequent  authentication can be done using the same key via Safari mobile browser.


=== Question: Will the Yubico SDK for iOS support YubiKeys over the “Apple Camera Connection Kit” for WebAuthn flow in a native app?

*Answer*: The supported YubiKeys for native apps using the Yubico iOS SDK are:

* YubiKey 5Ci for iPhones/iPads with Lightning connector,
* YubiKey 5 NFC for iPhones (7 and higher with NFC support), and the
* Security Key NFC by Yubico for NFC-enabled iPhones.

There is no YubiKey support for the iPad Pro with USB-C connector when using a native app.

If your native app incorporates the SFSafariViewController or SFSafariViewController for U2F/WebAuthn flow, the link:Security_Key_Compatibility.adoc[compatible YubiKeys] connected via the Apple Camera Connection Kit will work the same as they do with the Safari browser for iOS 13.3+ users.


=== Question: What value does the Yubico SDK for iOS provide?

*Answer*: The Yubico SDK for iOS supports *ALL* FIDO2 YubiKey functionality not available via Safari. It enables complete control over every aspect of the WebAuthn/U2F registration/authentication flow. The SDK provides libraries to interact with YubiKey authentication modules such as Challenge-Response, TOTP/HOTP (via OATH), PIV, and PGP.


=== Question: Can I just use WKWebView inside my app for WebAuthn flow?

*Answer*: Apple does not support FIDO2 security keys for the WebAuthn flow using the link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview[WKWebView]. You’ll need to rely on Safari browser, or embed the link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller[SFSafariViewController] or link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession[ASWebAuthenticationSession] into a native app.


=== Question: What are my options for supporting FIDO2 security keys on iOS/iPadOS versions prior to 13.3?

*Answer*: To support FIDO2 keys on iOS/iPadOS devices running versions prior to 13.3, you can direct your user to the link:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brave-private-web-browser/id1052879175[Brave Browser for iOS/iPadOS] or build an app store app with the link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-ios[Yubico Mobile iOS SDK] integrated.


=== Question:What Apple devices support the NFC for WebAuthn flow via Safari browser?

*Answer*: All iPhones 7 and newer support the NFC protocol for the WebAuthn flow.

[NOTE]
======
The iPhone 6 and iPhone SE have NFC but with limited capabilities used for Apple Pay, thus cannot be used for authentication flows.
