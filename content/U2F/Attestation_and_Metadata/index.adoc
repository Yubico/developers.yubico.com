== Attestation and metadata

=== Attestation certificates
Upon registration, a device gives the server its attestation certificate.
This certificate can be (optionally) used to verify the
authenticity of the device. For example, a banking site might wish users to be
able to provide their own U2F devices for two-factor authentication, but only
wishes to allow devices of certain approved vendors. For other sites it might
be more about being able to provide some useful device information to the user,
when listing his or her registered devices.

It's up to each U2F device vendor to decide what type of information goes into
the attestation certificates, and how the authenticity of a certificate is
validated. In Yubico's case, all our attestation certificates are signed by
link:/u2f/yubico-u2f-ca-certs.txt[our root CA].

NOTE: If you have a YubiKey Preview device, the attestation certificate will
instead be signed by our link:/u2f/fido-preview-ca-cert.pem[Yubico FIDO Preview CA].

=== Yubico's metadata format

NOTE: This is not part of the U2F standard.

The attestation certificates are often small, and do not contain much
information about the device model itself. For this reason Yubico has specified a
metadata format which allows mapping attestation certificates to additional
information about the device model and vendor, providing product images, etc.
Yubico provides such metadata about our devices
link:/u2f/yubico-metadata.json[here]. Several of our
link:/Software_Projects/FIDO_U2F/U2F_Server_Libraries/[U2F server libraries]
are capable of reading this format.
