== U2F Walk-Through

[Note]
======
The U2F libraries are now deprecated and no longer maintained. We highly recommend transitioning to the FIDO2 libraries for enhanced security and compatibility.

This walk-through describes how to integrate the Yubico Universal Second Factor (U2F) protocol with your application or framework.


=== Implementation Methods

There are three methods for integrating Yubico authentication using the U2F protocol. For the purposes of this walk-through we describe the Plugin method.


==== Plugins for Content Management Systems (CMS).
Plugin modules for link:../pam-u2f/[PAM] (pluggable authentication module) and for link:https://github.com/search?q=u2f[Git].


==== Standalone Authentication Server
Use the Yubico link:../Standalone_servers/U2FVAL_REST_API.adoc[REST API] and a U2F validation server, link:../u2fval/[U2FVAL].


==== link:../Libraries[Libraries for Programming Languages]
Store and access U2F artifacts yourself.


=== Plugin Implementation
On your product or company server, configure for using Yubico U2F with a plugin. See link:../Plugins.adoc[Plugins].


==== Git Plugin
Select from the listed link:https://github.com/search?q=u2f[Github] options and follow the steps for the plugin you choose.


=== PAM Plugin
The PAM plugin requires Yubico U2F link:https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host[libu2f-host-dev] and link:https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-server[libu2f-server-dev] libraries.

==== Step 1: Build the project
Debian
....
apt-get install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libu2f-host-dev libu2f-server-dev --no-install-recommends
....

From a tarball
....
$ ./configure
$ make
....

Build from Git

Check out sources:
....
$ git clone git://github.com/Yubico/pam-u2f.git
....

Create directory, for example: pam-u2f
....
$ cd pam-u2f
....

Install libraries

Debian
....
apt-get install autoconf automake libtool libpam-dev libu2f-host-dev libu2f-server-dev asciidoc xsltproc libxml2-utils docbook-xml --no-install-recommends
....

Generate build system
....
$ autoreconf --install
....


==== Step 2: Install files
Copy the file, pam_u2f to the /lib/.../security directory.
....
$ ./configure --with-pam-dir=
....

Create a file for the new service
....
$ auth sufficient pam_u2f.so debug
....


==== Step 3: Create mapping between YubiKey token and usernames
Choose between individually manged by user, or centrally-managed.

**Individually managed by user**

Each user performs these steps on their home directory.

Create directory and file
....
$  .config/Yuibico/u2f_keys
....

Add content to file
....
<username>:<KeyHandle1>,<UserKey1>:<KeyHandle2>,<UserKey2>:...
....

**Centrally managed users**

Create mapping file, for example: /etc/u2f_mappings
....
<username1>:<KeyHandle1>,<UserKey1>:<KeyHandle2>,<UserKey2>:...
<username2>:<KeyHandle1>,<UserKey1>:<KeyHandle2>,<UserKey2>:...
....

Add file to PAM configuration line
....
auth sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/u2f_mappings
....


==== Step 4: Register the token device

....
pamu2fcfg -uusername -opam://myorigin -ipam://myappid
....

=== Attestation and Metadata
All Yubico devices attestation certificates are signed by the Yubico link:https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/yubico-u2f-ca-certs.txt[root CA].

Yubico devices provide additional link:https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/yubico-metadata.json[device information] in the mapping attestation certificate. This is used by several of the link:https://developers.yubico.com/Software_Projects/[WebAuthn libraries].See link:https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Attestation_and_Metadata/[Attestation and metadata].


=== App ID
Specify the Facet ID, that is the platform-specific identifier (URI) for your application, where the Facet is how an application is implemented on a platform, such as Android app or Web app.

* Single-facet app

Example
....
https://example.com
....

* Multi-facet app

Include all facets in an HTTPS resolvable file.

Example
....
https://example.com/app-id.json
....

Sample JSON file
....
{ "trustedFacets" : [{
"version": { "major": 1, "minor" : 0 },
"ids": [
"https://login.example.com",
"https://secure.example.com",
"android:apk-key-hash:585215fd5153209a7e246f53286035838a0be227"
]
}]
}
....


=== Module Validation
Submit your module to YubiKey OTP Validation Server, link:https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-val/[https:..developers.yubico.com/yubikey-val].
