Yubico has declared end-of-life of YubiKey Validation Server (YK-VAL) and YubiKey Key Storage Module (YK-KSM). These have been moved to link://github.com/YubicoLabs/yubikey-ksm[YubicoLabs] as a reference architecture. See article, link:/support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021227000[YK-VAL, YK-KSM and YubiHSM 1 End-of-Life].

== Migrating from yubikey-ksm to python-pyhsm

This guide will take you through the steps needed to migrate from using the
PHP-based yubikey-ksm to using python-pyhsm. Benefits of using python-pyhsm
include the ability of using a YubiHSM to protect Yubico OTP secrets. We will
assume you have a functioning yubikey-ksm installation with some credentials
which need to be migrated. These instructions are for systems running Ubuntu
Linux. Most of this guide will apply to other distributions as well, but the
commands to install the software may be different.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are migrating from yubikey-ksm for the purpose of using a YubiHSM to
protect secrets, it is important that you securely wipe the old plaintext
secrets used by yubikey-ksm. It's strongly recommended that you set up a new
server for yhsm-yubikey-ksm using a YubiHSM in production, and never expose any
plaintext secrets to that machine. Plaintext secrets should only be handled on
a secure computer that is not (and will not be) connected to the Internet.
====

=== Installing python-pyhsm
First we'll install the python based KSM (Key Storage Module). By default it
will run on a different port than the existing yubikey-ksm, so there is no
issue in having both at the same time:

  $ sudo apt-get install yhsm-yubikey-ksm

==== Option 1: Using a YubiHSM
If you have the ability to use a YubiHSM to protect the Yubico OTP secrets then
it is recommended that you do so. You will first have to configure the YubiHSM
with at least 1 key handle with the proper permissions. For detailed
instructions on how to set up a YubiHSM, see the YubiHSM Reference Manual which
is available link:https://www.yubico.com/products/yubihsm/[here]. For this
guide we will assume key handle 1 will be used, and is configured for at least
OTP decryption (the YSM_AEAD_YUBIKEY_OTP_DECODE permission).

Now, we need to configure the yhsm-yubikey-ksm server to use the YubiHSM, and
to start automatically on boot. Start by editing the configuration file:

  $ sudo nano /etc/default/yhsm-yubikey-ksm

Change the following values (if you've set an unlock passphrase you can
configure that as well):

  YHSM_KSM_ENABLE="true"
  YHSM_KSM_KEYHANDLES="1"

Then save and close the file.

==== Option 2: Storing the master key on disk
If you're not going to be using a YubiHSM to protect the secrets then you will
have to store a master key in plaintext on disk. This file will be used in lieu
of the YubiHSM device. This is one example of setting up such a file:

  $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/yubico/yhsm
  $ sudo nano /etc/yubico/yhsm/keys.json

The file should contain a JSON object with key handles mapped to AES keys in
hex format, we will use this example:

....
{
  "1": "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f"
}
....

We save and close the file, and we now have a keyhandle "1" set up to use a
dummy AES key. You will want to replace the value used in this example with a
randomly generated key. While you can have multiple key handles, we will stick
to using this single one in this guide. Because we want to limit the access to
this file, we change ownership and permissions of the file to be readable only
by the `yhsm-ksmsrv` user, which was created during the installation of the
software:

  $ sudo chown yhsm-ksmsrv /etc/yubico/yhsm/keys.json
  $ sudo chmod 400 /etc/yubico/yhsm/keys.json

Now, we need to configure the yhsm-yubikey-ksm server to use this file, and to
start automatically on boot. Start by editing the configuration file:

  $ sudo nano /etc/default/yhsm-yubikey-ksm

Change the following values:

  YHSM_KSM_ENABLE="true"
  YHSM_KSM_DEVICE="/etc/yubico/yhsm/keys.json"
  YHSM_KSM_KEYHANDLES="1"

Then save and close the file.

==== Verifying that yhsm-yubikey-ksm is configured correctly
Regardless of if you are using a YubiHSM or not, you have made configuration
changes and now need to restart the yhsm-yubikey-ksm daemon:

  $ sudo service yhsm-yubikey-val restart

=== Migrating existing data
We will now migrate the existing data from yubikey-ksm to yhsm-yubikey-ksm. In
yubikey-ksm the data is stored in an SQL database, and can be exported using
the `ykksm-export` command. In yhsm-yubikey-ksm the data is stored encrypted on
the disk, in an AEAD format. You can create these AEAD files using the included
yhsm-import-keys command:

  $ sudo su
  # printf "# ykksm 1\n`ykksm-export`" | yhsm-import-keys --key-handles 1 -D /etc/yubico/yhsm/keys.json

This will encrypt the plaintext secrets using the given AES key (which should
correspond to key handle 1 in your YubiHSM or keys.json file). The resulting
AEAD files will be created under /var/cache/yubikey-ksm/aeads/, where
yhsm-yubikey-ksm will automatically find them.

==== Verification of migrated data
We can verify the newly created AEADs by attempting to use them to decrypt an
OTP. For this we need a YubiKey that contains a credential that was already in
the yubikey-ksm database. Using curl, we first attempt to decrypt an OTP using
the existing yubikey-ksm installation:

  $ curl http://localhost/wsapi/decrypt?otp=internccccccfclhvbdbhudbjhvkidevcnbnblldhjfb
  OK counter=0004 low=421d high=52 use=01

Now, we try the same OTP using yhsm-yubikey-ksm instead, which (by default)
runs on port 8002:

  $ curl http://localhost:8002/wsapi/decrypt?otp=internccccccfclhvbdbhudbjhvkidevcnbnblldhjfb
  OK counter=0004 low=421d high=52 use=01

We got the same result, so the migration was successful.

=== Updating yubikey-val configuration
Any instance of yubikey-val which was using our earlier yubikey-ksm
installation should be re-configured to use the new yhsm-yubikey-ksm
installation instead. On all server running yubikey-val, edit the following
file:

  $ sudo nano /etc/yubico/val/ykval-config.php

Locate the otp2ksmurls function near the bottom of the file and make sure any
URL listed there which is pointing to the older yubikey-ksm installation is
updated with the new port. Close the file, and reload the configuration:

  $ sudo service apache2 reload

Verify that this new setup works (this assumes yubikey-val is running on the
same machine):

  $ curl "http://localhost/wsapi/2.0/verify?id=1&nonce=12345678901234567890&otp=internccccccfclhvbdbhudbjhvkidevcnbnblldhjfb"
  h=YD17lqu4gUJO7kqAYXHBekieoyk=
  t=2016-11-01T13:05:05Z0392
  otp=internccccccfclhvbdbhudbjhvkidevcnbnblldhjfb
  nonce=12345678901234567890
  sl=0
  status=OK

[NOTE]
====
While yubikey-ksm by default listens on any network interface (0.0.0.0),
yhsm-yubikey-ksm only listens to the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) by default.
This means that if yubikey-val is running on a different host than
yhsm-yubikey-val it will not be able to access the KSM without further
configuration. While it is possible to configure yhsm-yubikey-ksm to listen on
any interface, the recommended approach is to not expose it to the Internet to
prevent possible denial of service attacks. Instead, the recommended approach
is to whitelist only your own validation servers to connect to the KSM, using
for example SSH tunnels or firewall rules.
====

=== Removing yubikey-ksm
Now that we've got the old data migrated to yhsm-yubikey-ksm, as well as
verified it, we can remove the old data and yubikey-ksm installation:

  $ sudo apt-get purge yubikey-ksm

During removal, we are prompted to confirm that we want to deconfigure and
delete the yubikey-ksm database tables, which we do. This completes the guide.
