== One-Time Password (OTP) Walk-Through

We are going to walk through integrating the Yubico One-Time Password (OTP) protocol with your application or framework, step by step.

TIP: This walk through is designed for people who prefer to *learn by doing*. If you prefer learning concepts from the ground up, check out our link:https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/YubiKey-Authentication-Module-Design-Guideline-v1.0.pdf[YubiKey Authentication Module Design Guideline]. You might find this walk through and the guide are complementary to each other.

The walk through is divided into a few sections:

* Setup will give you a starting point to follow the walk through
* Overview will teach you the fundamentals of OTP
* Enable your Yubikey API Authenticator
* Create your Verification Client
* Add Authentication logic

We recommend you check out https://demo.yubico.com/otp/verify if you are new to OTP.

=== Overview

With One-Time Password (OTP), symetric-key cryptography is used to authenticate users against a central server, also known as a Relying Party (RP). The OTP is validated by a central server for users logging into your application.

1. When your users register for your application, a credential key pair, specific to your application, (your application private key and a public key), is generated on the authenticator (YubiKey).

2. Then the symetric-key is shared with the validation server prior to being used to generate OTPs. This must be done at programming level since the key cannot be extracted from the YubiKey.

3. When your user makes the request to log in, the YubiKey generates an OTP to be sent to the verification server (YubiCloud). The response from YubiCloud verifies the OTP is valid.

4. After the OTP is verified, your application uses the public identity to validate that the YubiKey belongs to the user.

5. Then your user is allowed to log in to your application.

=== Setup

Incorporating YubiKey authentication into your application or platform, uses four components. You will be creating, configuring, and using these items throughout this walk through.

 * Verfication server

 * YubiKey API authenticator

 * Verification  client

 * Authentication logic


*Verification server*

The YubiCloud is Yubico's free OTP validation service.

The verification server validates the OTPs generated by the YubiKey.  The verification server must have the secret symetric-key uploaded to it, prior to verifying OTPS. Every YubiKey is registered to the YubiCloud by default.

If the YubiCloud configuration is overwritten, use the link:https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubikey-manager/[YubiKey Manager] to re-register the YubiKey with the YubiCloud.

Yubico provides and recommends you use the YubiCloud verification server.

Optionally, you can self-host a verification server. See link:https://developers.yubico.com/Software_Projects/Yubico_OTP/YubiCloud_Validation_Servers/[YubiCloud Validation Servers] for options on creating your own verification server.


*Your YubiKey API authenticator*

Obtain a YubiKey. See link:https://www.yubico.com/products/[The YubiKey]

In the steps, you will register your YubiKey to give you access to the Yubico API.

You will also be able to run the OTP demo server to verify your application supports multiple YubiKeys per user.


*Your Verification client*

This is the core task in this walk-through. You will be setting up your verification server (YubiCloud) client. Your YubiCloud client provides the pass through logic between your users, their YubiKeys, and YubiCloud.

*Authentication logic*

This is the code you need to create and include in your application or framework. There are specific requirements to ensure one YubiKey provides access to multiple applications on a framework.

=== Enable your Yubikey API Authenticator

Sign up for and acquire your API key.

==== Review YubiCloud and Client Interactions

Optionally, for testing and example purposes, use a browser to view responses and actions in plain text. All the clients are a means to take the action and support applications.

*Step 1* Open a browser and insert your YubiKey into your computer’s USB port.

The YubiKey connects to the api.yubico.com validation server. The browser displays:

	 h=string of characters
	 t=timestamp
	 status=MISSING_PARAMETER

*Step 2* Follow Keyboard Setup Assistant.

a) Click Continue.

b) Tap YubiKey. The YubiKey in this case is the keyboard

c) Select Keyboard Type. Then click Done.

d) Tap YubiKey again.

The browser page updates and complete a one time password. The first 12 characters of the `opt=` are the Private Key for the inserted YubiKey.

	h=string of characters
	t=timestamp
	otp=string of characters
	nonce=string of characters
	sl=100
	status=OK


==== Register Access to the Yubico API

*Step 1* In a browser window, go to the Yubico API registration URL, link:https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/[Yubico API key signup]

a) Enter your email address.

b) Generate an OTP from your API YubiKey in the OTP field.

c) Accept the Terms and Conditions.

d) Click Get API key.

*Step 2* Record the Client ID and Secret key.

These values are used to authenticate your users on the YubiCloud. One Client ID/Secret key pair is required for every application you create.

*Note:* These values are never shared again. Do not loose them.

If any there is any reason Yubico needs to shutdown your client access to the YubiCloud, due to malicious activities, use the YubiKey values to verify your identity.


=== Create your Verification Client

For this phase of the process, you select a library and embed the Client ID and Secret Key in your library to create your YubiCloud client.

When your users use their YubiKeys for authentication, your client does the following:

•	Implements the OTP transport protocol
•	Parses the response from validation server (YubiCloud)

*Step 1* Choose a Yubico OTP library or create your own.

For each client, the hooks for integration are different, due to the different syntaxes and structure for each language.

*Select from the Yubico provided libraries.*

The PHP, dotNet and Java clients are called by an application, and should be imported as you would a standard library. The code to use them is included in the dev.yubico.com pages for each language, in the sections, "Usage".

 * link:https://developers.yubico.com/php-yubico/[PHP]

 * link:https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-dotnet-client/[DotNET]

 * link:https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-java-client/[Java]

The C client and perl client need to be integrated into an application by including the libraries in the standard manner. However, you need to build the client functions - this provides much more flexibility in the process, but does require additional work. The comments in the source code for the sample client applications detail the structure and steps.

 * link:https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-c-client/[C]

 * link:https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-perl-client/[Perl]

 * link:https://developers.yubico.com/windows-apis/[Windows]

*Optionally, build your own library.*

See link:[Creating your own library]https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/Libraries/Creating_your_own_library.html

*Step 2* Create your YubiCloud client using your library and set the listed actions.

See link:https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/Libraries/Using_a_library.html[Using a Yubico OTP library]

a) Send requests. Add to your client:

	client = Yubico(clientId, secretKey)

Enter the `clientId` and `secretKey` you saved from registering your YubiKey for an API Key, at link:https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey[].

b) Verify submitted OTPs. Add to your client:

	otp_is_valid = client.verify(otp)

The `otp=` value is the OTP from the users inserted YubiKey.

c) Verify user login. Add to your client:

	assert otp[:12] == user.yubikey_id

12 indicates the first 12 numbers from the `otp=` field. On the YubiCloud  validation server, this value is compared with the YubiKey ID that is associated with the user.

d) Provision user YubiKeys.

Provisioning is assigning a YubiKey ID to a User ID.

	user.yubikey_id = otp[:12]

Add these association entries to your database. For example:

	YubiKeyID : UserID


=== Add Authentication Logic to your Application

In your application, add the logic needed to process registration and authentication requests. See link:https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/OTPs_Explained.html[OTPs Explained].

==== User Registration

Enable users to register with your application or platform.

*Steps 1* Expose a connection to your user interface that accepts the OTP for launching the application. For example, provide direction for your users to insert the YubiKey. See link:https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/[What is Yubico OTP?]. This connection sends the OTP download to the YubiCloud client for validation.

*Step 2* Use the YubiKey Public ID and associate it with the registering user.

*Step 3* Store the `YubiKeyID : UserID` pairs in your database.

*Step 4* Add logic in in your application to check the UserID for a valid OTP response. This response is from the YubiKey validation server.

==== User Authentication

Do a logic check and ensure your registered users can authenticate with your application. See link:https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/OTPs_Explained.html[OTPs Explained].

During authentication:

*Step 1* Ensure your application retrieves the OTP from an inserted and tab-touched YubiKey.

For two-factor authentication, add a field or other means to enter credentials. Indicate that the YubiKey must also be inserted and tab-touched.

*Step 2* Pass the OTP to your YuviCloud client.

Your YubiCloud client validates the OTP in the YubiCloud. The YubiCloud validation server returns a response.

*Step 3* Have your Yubicloud client parse the response.

If a `valid` response is returned, proceed with the next step in authentication.

If YubiCloud rejects the submitted OTP, forward the YubiCloud validation server error message. This message indicate and OTP/Client error.

*Step 4* For a valid YubiCloud response, check the YubiKey public ID against the user ID pair in your database.

If a ‘valid’ response is returned, authenticate the user and log them in.

If the YubiKey ID and User ID do not match, send an error message. Create an appropriate error message.

As the developer, you are responsible for creating the public facing error messages.


==== Inspecting the code

Verify your client is compatible with your application code base and language.


=== Wrapping up
Congratulations! You've completed all the steps to enable your users to register and authenticate with an OTP credential.
