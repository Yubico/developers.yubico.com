== Using a YubiKey OTP library
NOTE: YubiKey OTPs can be validated by YubiCloud or a self-hosted validation server.
Throughout this document we will refer to both these alternatives simply as 'YubiCloud'.

This sequence diagram describes a typical YubiKey OTP implementation:

[mscgen]
----
msc {

   # Entities
   b [label="Browser"], s [label="Server"], y [label="YubiCloud"];

   # Arcs
   |||;
   b -> s [label = "OTP (and password)"];
   s rbox s [label="Verify password"];
   s -> y [label = "OTP", linecolor="#0000AA", textcolor="#0000AA"];
   y rbox y [label = "Verify OTP", linecolor="#0000AA", textcolor="#0000AA"];
   y -> s [label = "response", linecolor="#0000AA", textcolor="#0000AA"];
}
----

By using a library, you abstract away the communication with YubiCloud (highlighted in blue above).


=== Validating OTPs ===

The _ask library to validate OTP_ step in the diagram above could be implemented like this:

[source, python]
----
# otp is the OTP from the Yubikey
otp_is_valid = client.verify(otp)
----

After validating the OTP, you also want to make sure that the YubiKey belongs to the user logging in.
This is done by comparing the first 12 characters of the OTP (which is the YubiKey's ID) with the
YubiKey ID that is associated with the user:

[source, python]
yubikey_belongs_to_user = otp[:12] == user.yubikey_id

=== Provisioning YubiKeys ===
Provisioning is simply a matter of associating the first 12 characters of an OTP with a user in your user database.

.Associating a user with a YubiKey ID
[source, python]
user.yubikey_id = otp[:12]

Then, if you are using a SQL database, you might want to store it like this:

.SQL table example
[options="header"]
|=======================
|YubiKeyID    |   UserId
|ccfucnlcrrne |     1890
|ccnnloposxxc |     4371
|cccilddkfopf |     2285
|=======================

==== Self-provisioning ====
You can allow users to provision YubiKeys themselves. This is called
_self-provisioning_ and works like this:

1. On your website, provide the
option for users to associate a YubiKey with their account. When a user
registers, verify the OTP to make sure that the key is valid.

2. Later the user comes back to your site. Since the user has an 
associated YubiKey, ask for an OTP (that you verify) before logging
her/him in.


=== Client-side ===
The client-side (browser-side) is not handled by libraries. Luckily, you just have to add another text field to your existing login form. From a user point of view, _press Enter_ is replaced with _touch the YubiKey button_.
