NOTE: OTP plugins are End Of Life. Have a look at our link:/Software_Projects/YubiCloud_REST_API.html[YubiCloud REST API].

== Developing your own plugin
If you did not find what you are looking for in the list of available plugins (and in your favorite search engine),
one option is to develop your own integration plugin. This does not have to be all that hard if you
leverage an existing link:Libraries/Using_a_library.html[OTP validation library].
