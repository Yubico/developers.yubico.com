== OTPs Explained

A Yubico OTP is a 44-character, single-use, secure, 128-bit encrypted Public ID and
Password that is nearly impossible to spoof. The OTP is comprised of two major parts:
the first 12 characters remain constant and represent the Public ID of the YubiKey
device itself. The remaining 32 characters make up a unique passcode for each OTP
generated.

+++<code><b>cccjgjgkhcbb</b>gefdkbbditfjrlniggevfhenublfnrev</code>+++

+++<code><b>cccjgjgkhcbb</b>cvchfkfhiiuunbtnvgihdfiktncvlhck</code>+++
====

The passcode is generated from a multitude of random sources, including
counters for both YubiKey sessions and OTPs generated. When a Yubico OTP is verified,
the session and OTP counter values are compared to last values submitted.
If the counters are less than the previously used values the OTP is rejected.
Copying an OTP will not allow another user to spoof a YubiKey -- the counter value
will allow the validation server to know which OTPs have already been used.

The YubiKey OTP is encoded in modhex (Modified Hexadecimal), a format designed for maximum compatibility across host language settings. Modhex uses characters whose position on the keyboard is the same across many latin-script keyboard layouts similar to QWERTY.

It is easy to script the conversion from hexadecimal to modhex. For example, in Linux and POSIX systems, the command `tr` does the job:

`openssl rand -hex 6 | tr abcdef0123456789 lnrtuvcbdefghijk`

== The Yubico OTP generation algorithm
The YubiKey OTP generation is made up of the following fields, encrypted with a unique AES-128 bit key. The result is the 32-character modhex string included after the 12-character public ID.

=== Private ID
The private-id field comprises 6 bytes copied from the private-id configuration value. This field can be used to store a private identity which can be accessed when the OTP is decrypted in a Yubico OTP validation server holding the AES key used to encrypt the OTP.

[Note]
======
Yubico has declared end-of-life for the YubiKey Validation Server (YK-VAL) and the YubiKey Key Storage Module (YK-KSM). These have been moved to link://github.com/YubicoLabs/yubikey-ksm[YubicoLabs] as a reference architecture. See article, link:/support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021227000[YK-VAL, YK-KSM and YubiHSM 1 End-of-Life].
======

The verifying instance should verify the private-id field against the expected value. If an OTP is encrypted with a non-matching AES key, this field will be invalid and the OTP shall be rejected.

=== Session usage counter
The session usage counter is initiated to zero at power-up and is incremented by one every time a new OTP is generated. When this field wraps from 0xff to 0, the usage counter field is automatically incremented.

=== Usage counter
The usage counter is a non-volatile counter whose value is preserved even when the device is unplugged. The first time the device is used after a power-up or reset, this value is incremented by 1 and the session counter is set to zero.

This field is only 15 bits wide, giving a usable range from 1 to 0x7fff. When this counter reaches 0x7fff, it stops there. One might think that this constraint gives YubiKeys a short lifetime. However, if a YubiKey is used every day, five times a day, it will take 18 years for the counter to get stuck. In practice, the lifetime is even longer than that since this counter only increments each time the Yubikey powers up or resets. Finally, even when the usage counter reaches the final value, it is still possible to re-configure the device and reset the counter.

The usage counter is stored in little-endian format, i.e. the least significant byte is stored first.

=== Timestamp
The timestamp is a 24-bit field incremented at a rate of approximately 8 Hz. At startup, it is set to a random value using the internal random number generator.

The timestamp may be used by the verifying party to determine the time elapsed between two consecutive OTPs received during a single session.

This field automatically wraps from 0xffffff to 0. The verifying party must take this constraint into account. Given an 8 Hz rate, the timer will wrap approximately every 24 days.

The timestamp is stored in little-endian format, i.e. the least significant byte is stored first.

=== Random number
A 16-bit random number is picked from the internal random number generator to add some additional entropy to the final result.

=== Checksum
A 16-bit, ISO13239, 1's-complement checksum is added at the end. The checksum spans all bytes except the checksum itself. It is verified by calculating the checksum of all bytes, including the checksum field, where a valid checksum produces a fixed residual of 0xf0b8. If the checksum is invalid, the OTP shall be rejected.

The checksum is stored in little-endian format, i.e. the least significant byte is stored first.
