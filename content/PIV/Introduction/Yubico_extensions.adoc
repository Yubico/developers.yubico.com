|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xff
|P1  |0xff
|P2  |0xff for no touch, 0xfe for require touch
|=========

|==============
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfe
|P1  |Algorithm
|P2  |Key ID
|==============

=== Data
|======================================
|Tag P    |0x01 |P Value for RSA Key

|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfd
|P1  |0x00
|P2  |0x00
|=========

== RESET
Reset to default state. Only available if both PIN and PUK is blocked.

=== Syntax
|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfb
|P1  |0x00
|P2  |0x00
|=========

== SET PIN RETRIES
Set the PIN retries for PIN and PUK. Both PIN and PUK will be reset to default values when this is executed. For this authentication in management mode is required and PIN has to be validated.

=== Syntax
|================
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfa
|P1  |PIN retries
|P2  |PUK retries
|================

== PIN POLICY
Set PIN policy to be used for a key, valid for generate and import. Only available in YubiKey 4 & 5.

=== Syntax
The tag used is 0xaa and possible values are:
|=========================================================
|Default |0x00 |The default behaviour for that key is used
|Never   |0x01 |PIN is never checked for operations
|Once    |0x02 |PIN is checked once for the session
|Always  |0x03 |PIN is verified just before operation
|=========================================================

== TOUCH POLICY
Set touch policy to be used for a key, valid for generate and import. Only available in YubiKey 4 & 5.

=== Syntax
The tag used is 0xab and possible values are:
|==================================================================
|Default |0x00 |The default behaviour for that key is used
|Never   |0x01 |Touch is never required for operations
|Always  |0x02 |Touch is always required for operations
|Cached  |0x03 |Touch is cached for 15s after use (valid from 4.3).
|==================================================================

== ATTESTATION
Get an attestation certificate for a slot where the key has been generated on device. Only available in YubiKey 4.3 & 5.

The output is a DER encoded X.509 certificate.

=== Syntax
|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xf9
|P1  |Slot
|P2  |0x00
|=========

== GET SERIAL
Get the serial number of the device. Only available in YubiKey 5.

=== Syntax
|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xf8
|P1  |0x00
|P2  |0x00
|=========

Encoded as a four-bytes Big-Endian number: `0001e240` for serial number `123456`.

== GET METADATA
Get information about a specific key. Only available in YubiKey 5.3.

=== Syntax
|================
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xf7
|P1  |0x00
|P2  |Slot
|================

The following TLVs will be returned if the key is present:

|=========================================================================================
|Algorithm     |0x01 |Algorithm/type of the key
|Policy        |0x02 |PIN and Touch policy of the key (keys only)
|Origin        |0x03 |Origin of the key: imported or generated
|Public key    |0x04 |Public key associated with the private key
|Default value |0x05 |Whether the PIN/key has a default value (PIN, PUK and Mgmt key only)
|Retries       |0x06 |Number of retries left (PIN and PUK only)
|=========================================================================================

Use slot `0x80` for PIN, slot `0x81` for PUK and slot `0x9b` for the Management key.

Only the TLV that apply to an object will be returned.

== MOVE A KEY
Move a key from any slot except F9 (attestation) to any other slot except F9. Only available in YubiKey 5.7.

=== Syntax
|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xf6
|P1  |Slot (destination)
|P2  |Slot (source)
|=========
