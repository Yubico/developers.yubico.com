Require touch is only available on YubiKey 4 & 5.

=== Syntax
|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xff
|P1  |0xff
|P2  |0xff for no touch, 0xfe for require touch
|=========

=== Data
|================
|Algorithm  |0x03
|Key ID     |0x9b
|Key Length |24
|Key Data   |
|================


== IMPORT ASYMMETRIC KEY
Import a new asymmetric key. For this authentication with management key is required.

=== Syntax
|==============
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfe
|P1  |Algorithm
|P2  |Key ID
|==============

=== Data
|======================================
|Tag P    |0x01 |P Value for RSA Key
|Tag Q    |0x02 |Q Value for RSA Key
|Tag dP   |0x03 |dP Value for RSA Key
|Tag dQ   |0x04 |dQ Value for RSA Key
|Tag Qinv |0x05 |Qinv Value for RSA Key

|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfd
|P1  |0x00
|P2  |0x00
|=========

== RESET
Reset to default state. Only available if both PIN and PUK is blocked.

=== Syntax
|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfb
|P1  |0x00
|P2  |0x00
|=========

== SET PIN RETRIES
Set the PIN retries for PIN and PUK. Both PIN and PUK will be reset to default values when this is executed. For this authentication in management mode is required and PIN has to be validated.

=== Syntax
|================
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xfa
|P1  |PIN retries
|P2  |PUK retries
|================

== PIN POLICY
Set PIN policy to be used for a key, valid for generate and import. Only available in YubiKey 4 & 5.

=== Syntax
The tag used is 0xaa and possible values are:
|=========================================================
|Default |0x00 |The default behaviour for that key is used
|Never   |0x01 |PIN is never checked for operations
|Once    |0x02 |PIN is checked once for the session
|Always  |0x03 |PIN is verified just before operation
|=========================================================

== TOUCH POLICY
Set touch policy to be used for a key, valid for generate and import. Only available in YubiKey 4 & 5.

=== Syntax
The tag used is 0xab and possible values are:
|==================================================================
|Default |0x00 |The default behaviour for that key is used
|Never   |0x01 |Touch is never required for operations
|Always  |0x02 |Touch is always required for operations
|Cached  |0x03 |Touch is cached for 15s after use (valid from 4.3).
|==================================================================

== ATTESTATION
Get an attestation certificate for a slot where the key has been generated on device. Only available in YubiKey 4 & 5.3+.

The output is a DER encoded X.509 certificate.

=== Syntax
|=========
|CLA |0x00
|INS |0xf9
|P1  |Slot
|P2  |0x00
