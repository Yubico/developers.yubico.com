== PIV-enabled YubiKeys
The YubiKey 4 and 5 series along with the YubiKey NEO support the Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) interface specified in NIST SP 800-73 document
"Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV". This enables you to perform
RSA or ECC sign/decrypt operations using a private key stored on the smartcard,
through common interfaces like PKCS#11.

For information about what you can do with a PIV-enabled YubiKey, please see
the various sections in the menu on the left.

=== Technical details about the YubiKey PIV implementation
The default PIN code is 123456. The default PUK code is 12345678.

The default 3DES management key (9B) is
010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708.

[NOTE]
====
We urge you to change these values before using the PIV functionality for
any non-testing purpose. For details on what these keys do, see
link:Admin_access.adoc[Admin access].

The following key slots exist:

* 9A, 9C, 9D, 9E: RSA 1024, RSA 2048, or ECC secp256r1 keys
  (algorithms 6, 7, 11 respectively).

* 9B: Triple-DES key (algorithm 03) for PIV management. YubiKeys with firmware 5.4 and up also support AES-128 (algorithm 08), AES-192 (algorithm 0A) and AES-256 (algorithm 0C) keys for PIV management.

The maximum size of stored objects is 2025/3052 bytes for current versions of
YubiKey NEO and YubiKey 4 & 5, respectively.

Currently all functionality are available over both contact and contactless
interfaces (contrary to what the specifications mandate).
