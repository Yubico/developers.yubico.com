== Platform support
You can use your PIV-enabled YubiKey on a variety of platforms.

=== Windows
Windows has built-in PIV support. You can use it for logging in to an Active
Directory connected machine, to encrypt files using BitLocker, to sign
executables using signtool.exe, etc. For more information, see:

=== Linux and OS X
Linux and OS X support PIV by using the tools provided by the
https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki[OpenSC project].

This enables you to sign software, to authenticate over SSH, and so on.
