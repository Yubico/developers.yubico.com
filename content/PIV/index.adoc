== What is PIV?
abbr:PIV[Personal Identity Verification], or FIPS 201, is a US government
standard. It enables RSA or ECC sign/encrypt operations using a private key
stored on a smartcard (such as the YubiKey NEO), through common interfaces like
PKCS#11.

PIV is primarily used for non-web applications. It has built-in support under
Windows, and can be used on OS X and Linux via the OpenSC project.
