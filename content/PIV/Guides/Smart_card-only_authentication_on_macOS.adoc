== Smart card-only authentication on macOS
macOS support mandatory use of a smart card, which disables all
password-based authentication. This makes it possible to use a YubiKey with PIV 
support for all authentication on macOS, including computer login.

====
Warning: Enforcing smart card may lock you out from your machine if done incorrectly. Make sure to read the recovery section link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208372[here], and note that this enforcement applies to all users on the machine.
====

=== Prerequisites
* macOS High Sierra or later
* an administrator account with a password configured
* a YubiKey with the PIV application. Make sure you go through the link:../Guides/Device_setup.html[device setup.]
* link:/yubikey-manager[YubiKey Manager CLI] installed

=== Steps

1. Generate certificates on your YubiKey to be paired with macOS.

a. Generate key pairs for slot 9a and 9d, save public part to files.

  $ ykman piv generate-key 9a --algorithm ECCP256 /tmp/9a.pub
  $ ykman piv generate-key 9d --algorithm ECCP256 /tmp/9d.pub

b. Generate self-signed certificates, anything can be used as subject. You may also set the expiration, default is one year.:

  $ ykman piv generate-certificate 9a --subject "YubiKey 5" /tmp/9a.pub
  $ ykman piv generate-certificate 9d --subject "YubiKey 5" /tmp/9d.pub

2. Pair the the YubiKey with macOS

a. The public key hash should now be listed as an unpaired identity.

  $ sc_auth identities

b. Use the listed hash to pair the YubiKey with your user.

  $ sc_auth pair -h HASH -u USERNAME

c. Verify that your user is paired:

  $ sc_auth list

+
You may now use your YubiKey for login, but your password still works as well.

3. Install a configuration profile

a. To enforce the use of smart card a configuration profile needs to be installed. A sample profile can be found link:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208372[here.] Save the sample profile as `sample.mobileconfig`

b. Install the profile:

  $ profiles install --path sample.mobileconfig

The YubiKey is now required for all authentication tasks on the system.

=== Additional options

Note that even though this guide uses self-signed certificates, any
pair of certifcates stored in slot 9a and 9d may be used for pairing. To also verify that
the certificates used are trusted, configure the `checkCertificateTrust` option in the profile.

The `tokenRemovalAction` may be added to the profile to automatically start the screensaver
when the YubiKey is removed.
