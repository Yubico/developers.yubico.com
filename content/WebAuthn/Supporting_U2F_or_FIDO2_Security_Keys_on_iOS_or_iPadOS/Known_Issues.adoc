== Known Issues

This section covers known issues (as of January 2, 2020) when using 13.3+ Safari browser, SFSafariViewController, orASWebAuthenticationSession.

=== 1. User Verification (PIN Support)

It does not matter whether a FIDO2 PIN is set, required, or preferred: in all those cases, the Safari browser dialog does not prompt for a PIN.

[NOTE]
======
If the service from which the user is authenticating is a U2F flow only, then PIN on FIDO2 is a non-issue and the user will successfully authenticate. Learn more in the link:../WebAuthn_Developer_Guide/User_Presence_vs_User_Verification.adoc[User Presence vs User Verification section of our WebAuthn Developer Guide].

==== Required, Preferred, and Discouraged Parameters for User Verification

|Feature                       |Required    |Preferred   |Discouraged

“Required”, “Preferred”, and “Discouraged” are optional parameters sent to the client browser by the WebAuthn RP during user registration.


=== 2. Resident Credentials (Resident Key)

When the WebAuthn RP specifies the optional parameter `RequireResidentKey=TRUE`, the registration hangs and the user is never prompted to insert or tap the YubiKey. Learn more in the link:../WebAuthn_Developer_Guide/Resident_Keys.adoc[Resident Keys section of our WebAuthn Developer Guide].

==== Required (TRUE)/Required(FALSE) Parameters for Resident Credentials (ResidentKey)

|=====================================================================================

`Required: TRUE|FALSE` is an optional parameter sent by the WebAuthn RP to the client.


=== 3. Attestation

If the WebAuthn RP requests any attestation parameter other than `none`, registration fails and the user is never prompted to insert or tap a YubiKey. Learn more in the link:../WebAuthn_Developer_Guide/Attestation.adoc[Attestation section of our WebAuthn Developer Guide].
