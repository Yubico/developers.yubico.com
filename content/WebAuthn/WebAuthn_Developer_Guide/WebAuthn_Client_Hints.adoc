== WebAuthn client hints

Client hints are optional values sent by the relying party (RP) to help the browser prioritize authenticators during passkey flows, optimizing the user experience.

=== Why use client hints?

Client hints help optimize the user experience by guiding the browser to prioritize the preferred authenticator. Authentication flows often present users with multiple options at once, which can lead to decision fatigue or accidental selection of a less secure option.

Common problems users face include:

- Enterprise users with security keys being prompted to use their phone instead
- Inconsistent behavior across browsers, platforms and devices
- Lack of guidance when both platform and roaming authenticators are available

Here are some examples of where client hints can help:

- Prioritizing a security key (such as a YubiKey) when high assurance is required, such as in apps that handle personally identifiable information, financial data or sensitive communications like banking, healthcare, journalism  or political campaigns
- Prioritizing platform authenticators like Face ID or Windows Hello in low-assurance consumer apps where convenience is the focus
- Avoiding QR codes when only security keys are expected

NOTE: Client hints do not reveal which authenticators are present on the device, helping preserve user privacy and security.

=== Supported hint values

Client hints are passed in an ordered array in the `hints` field. They can be included in either registration or authentication requests.

Supported values include:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Hint | Description

| `"security-key"` | Suggests using a roaming authenticator like a YubiKey.
| `"client-device"` | Suggests using a platform authenticator like Windows Hello.
| `"hybrid"` | Suggests a cross-device flow, such as using a smartphone for passkey login.
|===

WARNING: Browsers that do not support the `hints` field will silently ignore it and proceed with default behavior. Passing an empty hints array or omitting the property entirely indicates no preference and shows standard WebAuthn options.

=== Using multiple hints

You can pass multiple hints in the array to offer fallback options. Browsers prioritize the first hint and may fall back to others if unavailable.

.Example
[source,json]
----
"hints": ["security-key", "client-device"]
----

In this example, the browser will try to show a security key first. If unavailable, it may fall back to a platform authenticator.

=== How client hints differ from `authenticatorAttachment`

`authenticatorAttachment` is an authoritative directive that tells the browser which types of authenticators are allowed.  In contrast, client hints are optional suggestions that help the browser improve the user experience by ordering options in a more intuitive way.

Use both together for the best experience: `authenticatorAttachment` enforces requirements, while client hints guide user interface behavior by suggesting a preferred authenticator order.

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Feature | `authenticatorAttachment` | `client hints` (`hints`)

| Purpose
| Filters allowed authenticator types
| Suggests preferred authenticator types

| Enforced by browser?
| ✅ Yes: operation fails if no match
| ❌ No: advisory only, ignored if unsupported

| Fallback behavior
| Blocks if no matching authenticator is available
| Silently proceeds with default behavior

| Browser support
| Widely supported across all major browsers
| Varies by browser and platform.

|===

To ensure compatibility with older browsers that don’t support `hints`, always set `authenticatorAttachment` to align with your hint type. For example:

* `"security-key"` → `cross-platform`
* `"client-device"` → `platform`
* `"hybrid"` → `cross-platform`

Browsers that don’t recognize `hints` will still honor `authenticatorAttachment`, preserving expected behavior.

=== Implementation guidance

To implement client hints, add the `hints` property to PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions for create() calls, and PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions for get() calls. Examples of both are shown below.

Example: registration options with hints

[source,json]
----
"publicKey": {
  "rp": ...,
  "user": ...,
  "challenge": "uhUjPNlZfvn7onwuhNdsLPkkE5Fv-lUN",
  "pubKeyCredParams": ...,
  "authenticatorSelection": ...,
  "attestation": "direct",
  "hints": ["security-key", "client-device", "hybrid"]
}
----

Example: authentication options with hints

[source,json]
----
"publicKey": {
  "challenge": "NGc3jpB4Q-VnOmbhFBnDAczlYPT4soKA7xviGeJmDhc",
  "timeout": 180000,
  "rpId": "localhost",
  "userVerification": "preferred",
  "hints": ["security-key", "client-device", "hybrid"]
}
----

The Yubico `webauthn-server-core` library defines the `PublicKeyCredentialHint` class, which defines the supported hint values.

=== Platform support

Before implementing client hints, verify that your target browser, operating system or device supports client hints.
