== WebAuthn Client Hints

Client hints are optional values sent by the relying party (RP) to help the browser decide which authenticators to show first in the UI. They aim to improve the user experience in passkey flows.

TIP: Use client hints to improve the user experience by guiding the browser to show the most relevant authenticator first. This is especially helpful when users have multiple authenticators available.

=== Supported Hint Values

Client hints are passed in an ordered array in the `hints` field. They can be included in either registration or authentication requests.

Supported values include:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Hint | Description

| `"security-key"` | Suggests using a roaming authenticator like a YubiKey.
| `"client-device"` | Suggests using a platform authenticator like Windows Hello.
| `"hybrid"` | Suggests a cross-device flow, such as using a smartphone for passkey login.
|===

NOTE: Clients that do not support the `hints` field will silently ignore it and proceed with default behavior.

=== Usage in Registration

Client hints can be passed during registration using `StartRegistrationOptions`:

[source,java]
----
StartRegistrationOptions options = StartRegistrationOptions.builder()
    .user(userIdentity)
    .hints(List.of(PublicKeyCredentialHint.SECURITY_KEY))
    .build();
----

=== Usage in Authentication

Client hints can also be passed during authentication using `StartAssertionOptions`:

[source,java]
----
StartAssertionOptions options = StartAssertionOptions.builder()
    .username(Optional.of("user@example.com"))
    .hints(List.of(
        PublicKeyCredentialHint.HYBRID,
        PublicKeyCredentialHint.CLIENT_DEVICE
    ))
    .build();
----
